Over the last week, CERT-SE has been assisting a Swedish logistics provider after detection of unauthorized updates being pushed through their internal package management server (specifically, their Artifactory instance). For context, this supplier is connected to several EU customs and trade systems, so we\u2019re treating this as a high-priority incident with possible cross-border impact.\n\nInitial analysis points to a compromise of a Jenkins automation pipeline (details in attached CSV), which then pushed modified container images to downstream clients. We\u2019ve identified three images containing embedded Python scripts (SHA256: 56b8a...1cf and 2 others in the attachment) that beacon out to api-checkpoint[.]cloud via port 8090/tcp. No hits in public threat feeds as of this morning. The TTPs resemble elements from the \"BrassKite\" cluster, though attribution is low-confidence at this stage. MITRE mapping so far: T1195.002 (Supply Chain Compromise), T1048.003 (Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol).\n\nWe\u2019re still reviewing internal network telemetry and have begun contacting affected partners. At this point, we\u2019d appreciate any CTI you might have on recent supply chain targeting of EU logistics or customs infrastructure, especially:\n- Sightings of api-checkpoint[.]cloud or related C2 endpoints\n- Similar malicious pipeline modifications (Jenkins/Artifactory, Docker images, etc.)\n- Actor profiling or campaign codenames that fit this pattern\n\nWe\u2019ve attached our initial IOC list (defanged), as well as YARA rules for the Python beacon payload. Sorry if there\u2019s any odd formatting in the CSV \u2013 quick export from our SIEM.\n\nLet me know if you need further technical details, or if you\u2019ve seen related activity.

This notification is part of an ongoing investigation into potential supply chain compromise indicators, following anomalous activity detected over the past 48 hours.\n\nOn 27 June, our monitoring systems flagged a series of unexpected API calls originating from our automation hub towards third-party endpoints, including hxxps://webhook-connector[.]eu and hxxps://data-push[.]cloud. These requests coincided with a recent update to the automation platform\u2019s integration module (version 5.8.2), which, according to vendor release notes, introduced changes to API authentication and data parsing routines. Since the update, several automation workflows have failed, and log analysis revealed attempts to redirect data flows to unrecognised domains, some of which overlap with indicators listed in recent ENISA supply chain threat advisories.\n\nWe have attached a zipped log extract (CSV format) highlighting the anomalous API calls, including timestamps, source/destination IPs, and observed payloads. Initial review suggests the use of TTPs consistent with MITRE ATT&CK T1195.002 (Supply Chain Compromise \u2013 Software Dependencies and Development Tools). No confirmed data exfiltration has been observed at this stage, but the integration failures are disrupting business processes and raise concerns about possible lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.\n\nCould you please advise if CERT-EU or other EU institutions have observed similar patterns or indicators related to recent automation platform updates?

I\u2019m not a security expert myself, but one of our developers flagged this and I promised to pass it along. The team noticed that the system\u2019s REST API (specifically the endpoint POST /api/v2/payrun/submit) does not enforce any IP allowlisting or mTLS, and appears to accept requests from any origin, so long as a session token is provided.\n\nThe bigger concern is that, when testing session expiry, our devs found that an expired JWT token could be replayed for several minutes after its stated expiry time. In one case, an old token (expired for 7+ minutes) was still accepted and the API processed the submission. No rate limiting or invalidation was triggered. We confirmed this behavior with two separate test users (finance-auditor1 and payroll-admin3), but didn\u2019t attempt any actual data modification beyond test payloads.\n\nWe\u2019re worried this could allow an attacker with access to a stale token (via phishing or some other means) to submit or alter payroll data, especially since the API is reachable externally. I\u2019ve attached logs showing the replayed request, server response (HTTP 200), and timestamps. No PII or sensitive data included, just dummy entries. Our IT department is not sure if this is a config oversight or something deeper in the session validation logic \u2014 the vendor is investigating, but as we\u2019re handling EU personnel payroll, we thought it best to escalate via CERT-EU\u2019s responsible disclosure framework.\n\nWe\u2019d appreciate guidance on whether this falls under coordinated disclosure, and if there\u2019s an embargo or notification policy we should follow with the vendor.

Apologies if this isn\u2019t the right place.\n\nWe\u2019ve been seeing a spike in outbound connections from several workstations in our Brussels office to what appears to be a rarely-used TOR exit node (176.115.83.72) since last Friday afternoon. The traffic pattern is odd\u2014connections occur in short bursts (usually 7-10 minutes), mostly between 02:00 and 04:00 CET, and are always initiated from the same three endpoints (HR-WS-14, LEGAL-WS-08, and ADMIN-WS-03). None of these users report any knowledge of TOR usage or have legitimate business reasons for this kind of traffic.\n\nOur internal scans flagged two unfamiliar executable files in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directories on the affected machines: \u2018update-hrsvc2.exe\u2019 and \u2018docsigner-temp3.exe\u2019. Both were first written to disk within minutes of the initial TOR connections. Windows Defender didn\u2019t flag them, but a quick check with VirusTotal (submission IDs: 0e7d2a and 3f5b1c) returned a handful of recent detections, mostly from smaller vendors.\n\nWe haven\u2019t identified any data exfiltration yet, but proxy logs show POST requests to a .onion address (z3rc4shq7g2vnd5w[.]onion) via the exit node above. There\u2019s no mention of this onion domain in our existing threat feeds. I\u2019m attaching a CSV with connection timestamps, local IPs, and hashes for the two executables (SHA256: 19e0b3e1d8c65a14f6b9d3c1b8d1e12a6e1e2d0a2f3b4a6c7d8e9f0a1b2c3d4e and 5c2e7a1b3d4f8e9c0a2b1c3d5e6f7a8b9c0d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8f9a0b1c2d3e4f).\n\nCan you check if there\u2019s any current campaign or actor associated with this exit node or onion address? Also, are there known TTPs mapping to this pattern? We\u2019re treating this as a routine report for now, but happy to escalate if you see signs of something bigger.

I am reaching out from the IT Procurement Office at the Council of the European Union regarding the renewal process for the ESET Endpoint Protection licenses currently deployed across our shared cybersecurity workstations. We recently received the pro forma invoice (ref: ESET2024-PO-CEU-19) from your vendor relations desk, and before proceeding with the final approval, I would like to clarify a few administrative details to ensure compliance with both internal and inter-institutional procurement guidelines.\n\nFirstly, could you confirm whether the total number of endpoints (listed as 320 in the attached quote) reflects the most up-to-date inventory post the recent hardware refresh in April? Our records indicate a slight discrepancy, as we decommissioned 12 legacy devices during the last quarter. If there is a reconciliation report available, it would be helpful to cross-check figures before we validate the PO.\n\nSecondly, the invoice specifies a three-year term, whereas our initial request was for a two-year renewal to align with our budget planning cycle. Please advise if the vendor is flexible on this point or if a contract amendment is required. If so, could you provide the standard template for amendment requests or direct me to the relevant SharePoint location? \n\nLastly, we noticed that the invoice includes a line item for \"advanced threat analytics module\" which, to our knowledge, was not part of the original RFP. Kindly confirm whether this was bundled at no extra cost, or if there will be an additional administrative step to approve this module separately.\n\nFor your reference, I have attached the scanned PO draft and the vendor\u2019s quote (both in PDF). If there are any missing documents or forms you need from our side to expedite the approval, please let me know. Our finance controller is keen to finalize this before the end of the fiscal quarter to avoid any service gaps in endpoint protection coverage.\n\nThank you in advance for your assistance. Please feel free to call my direct line if you need further clarification, or if a quick Teams meeting would be more efficient.\n\nBest regards,\n\nR\u00e9mi Dufour\nIT Procurement Specialist\nCouncil of the European Union\nremi.dufour@consilium.europa.eu", "created_date": "2024-09-27T00:00:00", "email_address": "remi.dufour@consilium.europa.eu", "assigned_queue": "SMS"}

Over the past 10 days, we\u2019ve observed a spike in beaconing traffic from several French regional administrative offices to a previously untracked set of IPv6 addresses, all resolving via the DNS-over-HTTPS resolver operated by \"PrivAnon\" (not previously seen in our threat feeds).\n\nKey details:\n- Initial access appears to be brokered via forum posts on hxxps://eurozonegate[.]onion, advertising access to \".gouv\" and \".europa.eu\" subnets.\n- Our sandboxed detonation of a dropped loader (SHA256: 4f7b8e1b...7c2d9a) indicates the malware attempts outbound TLS connections to hxxps://vuln-exfil[.]pro, with fallback to IPv6 endpoints in the 2a0b:dbc0:42::/48 range.\n- TTPs include scheduled task creation (T1053.005) and use of WinHTTP for stealthy exfiltration (T1071.001), mapped via MITRE ATT&CK.\n- Payment for access is facilitated exclusively via Monero, and the actor\u2019s handle (\u201cBlueWren\u201d) is advertising weekly updates on compromised EU endpoints.\n\nEnclosed is a STIX 2.1 export (password: ctiFR2024) with IOCs (domains, IPs, hashes) and a brief markdown summary of our analysis. At this stage, attribution is low-confidence, but some overlap exists with infrastructure previously flagged by CERT-NL during their Q2 threat landscape review (see MISP event #2024-2371).\n\nWe\u2019re continuing to monitor for further activity and have notified affected French entities via our sectoral CERT channels. Would appreciate any cross-correlation you can provide, especially regarding:\n- Similar C2 patterns or actor mentions in your dark web monitoring\n- Observed traffic to the same IPv6 netblocks or domains in other EU member states\n- Recommendations for detection rules or YARA signatures\n\nSorry for the quick dump\u2014will send a more formal write-up once I\u2019m back at my desk. Please let us know if you need additional samples or want to coordinate a joint takedown. \n\nMerci et \u00e0 bient\u00f4t,\n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Laurent\nCTI Analyst\nCERT-FR", "created_date": "2024-07-29T00:00:00", "email_address": "frederic.laurent@cert.gouv.fr", "assigned_queue": "CTI"}

While attending a virtual coordination meeting on 2 July 2024, I noticed my account was unexpectedly logged out, and upon re-authentication, the application displayed session details (including partial token values and user identifiers) directly in the browser console.\n\nSubsequent review of the browser\u2019s developer tools revealed that sensitive session tokens were being transmitted in plaintext as part of WebSocket messages and persisted in local storage. These values appear accessible to any script running within the browser context, increasing the risk of token theft via XSS or browser extensions. I attempted standard troubleshooting steps (application restart, cache clear, system update), but the issue recurred across multiple devices and browsers. This suggests a potential misconfiguration or implementation flaw rather than a client-side problem.\n\nGiven the nature of the exposed data, there is a credible risk of account takeover or privilege escalation, especially if an attacker is able to inject malicious code or access the affected device. I have not attempted to exploit the issue further, in line with EU security policy, but I believe it warrants urgent investigation under CERT-EU\u2019s coordinated vulnerability disclosure framework.

We haven\u2019t seen this sequence before, so not sure if it\u2019s a simulated bypass or an actual bug.\n\nCould you confirm if this pattern is part of your test scenario, or if we need to escalate internally? The devs are a bit nervous since these repos touch our production deployment workflows. I\u2019ve attached the relevant auth logs and a screenshot from Kibana. Also, do you need us to temporarily unlock the \u2018svc_dataops\u2019 account for further testing, or should we leave it as-is for now?\n\nSorry for the rush \u2013 we\u2019re trying to avoid triggering an incident response unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary. Let me know if you need more details or access. Appreciate your quick feedback!\n\nThanks,\n\nMartina Kov\u00e1cs\nSystems Administrator\nJoint Research Centre \u2013 Ispra\nmartina.kovacs@jrc.ec.europa.eu\n\nAttachment: gitlab_jrc_2fa_eventlog_20240701.txt", "created_date": "2024-02-07T00:00:00", "email_address": "martina.kovacs@jrc.ec.europa.eu", "assigned_queue": "OFFSEC::Pentesting"}

{"ticket_id": "TKT-435E3731", "title": "Phishing Suspicion: Unusual ECB Security Audit Invitation Targeting DG HOME Staff", "content": "Hi CERT-EU DFIR team,\n\nI wanted to flag a strange email that landed in my inbox earlier today (see below for details). I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a phishing attempt or just a weird vendor notification, but it looked off enough that I figured it\u2019s better to check. I\u2019m a policy officer, so apologies if I miss any technical details \u2013 I\u2019ve pasted the main info as best I can.\n\nThe message came from what looks like a legitimate European Central Bank address (european-central@ecb-eu-alerts[.]org), but the domain is a bit odd. The subject was: \u201cURGENT: Confirm Your Participation in ECB Annual Security Audit\u201d. It says I need to click a link to confirm my attendance at a security audit next week. The link (I didn\u2019t click, just hovered!) is hxxps://ecb-security-check[.]org/confirm (I replaced the dots for safety, as our IT training says).\n\nThe body of the email is pretty formal, but there are some awkward phrases, like \u201cYour prompt action is mandatory to avoid exclusion from audit compliance.\u201d It also mentions that failure to respond will be reported to my department head, which seems a bit threatening for a simple event invite. There\u2019s a PDF attached called \u201cECB_Audit_Notice_2024.pdf\u201d but I haven\u2019t opened it.\n\nI checked with my line manager and no one in our unit (DG HOME, Policy Support) has heard about any audit like this. We usually get audit notifications through official channels, not random emails. The signature block uses the ECB logo, but it\u2019s blurry and the phone number listed is just a string of zeros. Also, the reply-to address is different from the sender: audit-confirm@ecb-audit-support[.]org.\n\nNot sure if I\u2019m overreacting, but the whole thing feels off. I\u2019ve attached the email as an .eml file (headers included) and a screenshot. I haven\u2019t interacted with the link or the attachment, and I\u2019ve warned my colleagues not to respond if they get something similar.\n\nPlease let me know if this is a known phishing campaign or just a one-off. Should we block the sender or do anything else? Sorry if this is a false alarm, but I\u2019d rather be safe.\n\nThanks for your help!\n\nBest,\n\nMartina Rossi\nPolicy Officer\nDG HOME \u2013 European Commission", "created_date": "2024-08-16T00:00:00", "email_address": "martina.rossi@ec.europa.eu", "assigned_queue": "DFIR::phishing"}
{"ticket_id": "TKT-7FF307E0", "title": "Clarification Needed on Onboarding Procedures for External Secondees \u2013 Danish NCSC Integration (Administrative Coordination", "content": "Dear CERT-EU HR Administration,\n\nI am writing to request clarification and support regarding the updated onboarding process for external secondees, specifically in relation to recent changes in the submission of security clearance documentation and contractual paperwork. We have two new colleagues from the Danish National Cyber Security Centre scheduled to begin their secondment at CERT-EU on 8 July, and we are encountering some confusion regarding the necessary administrative steps to finalise their onboarding.\n\nPreviously, our team submitted scanned copies of national security vetting certificates directly via the SecureDocs platform. However, the most recent communication from your office (dated 3 June) indicated a shift to using the eSignEU system for all sensitive document transfers and contract signatures. Unfortunately, our external partners are reporting persistent access issues when attempting to authenticate on eSignEU using their national eID cards (NemID), resulting in failed logins and incomplete uploads. We have attached screenshots of the error messages (defanged as per guidelines) and can provide further technical details if required.\n\nAdditionally, we are unclear about the deadlines for submitting the original hardcopy contracts and whether remote onboarding is permissible for the initial orientation week. Given the cross-border nature of this arrangement and ongoing travel restrictions, it would be helpful to have written confirmation of acceptable procedures for remote induction and any required forms (e.g., badge pre-registration, IT access request, GDPR training acknowledgment). Our Danish colleagues are eager to ensure full compliance with both CERT-EU and Commission standards, but we are keen to avoid administrative delays that could affect their planned start date.\n\nCould you kindly advise on the following points:\n- Is it possible to process security vetting documents via SecureDocs until eSignEU access is resolved?\n- What is the current policy regarding remote onboarding for external secondees, and are there any specific forms or checklists to complete?\n- Are digital signatures on contracts considered legally binding for secondments from non-EU national agencies?\n\nIf a coordination call would help clarify the process, we are available later this week. Please let us know if there are updated guidelines or templates we should share with our partners. Thank you in advance for your assistance and patience with these cross-border arrangements.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMalene S\u00f8rensen\nLiaison Officer, Danish National Cyber Security Centre\n\nAttachments: eSignEU_Login_Error[.]png, Vetting_Process_Guide.pdf", "created_date": "2024-10-03T00:00:00", "email_address": "malene.sorensen@nscsc.dk", "assigned_queue": "SMS"}
