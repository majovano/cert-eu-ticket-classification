The message says it\u2019s from \u201cEU eID Support\u201d and tells me my digital ID card is about to expire, with a big blue button to \u201crenew credentials.\u201d The sender address is eidsupport@eu-idrenewal[.]org (which doesn\u2019t look right to me?).\n\nI almost clicked the button but noticed the link (hxxps://eu-idportal[.]org/renew-now) doesn\u2019t match the official site I used before. The email has a logo that looks like the one on the real eID site, but the text is a bit off and there\u2019s a typo in my surname. No attachments, just the button and a note saying my \u201cEU access may be restricted.\u201d\n\nNot sure if this is something you track for citizens or just staff, but figured I\u2019d send it over just in case. Let me know if you need the full message or headers (I\u2019m not sure how to get those but can try).\n\nThanks,\n\nElena Popescu", "created_date": "2025-06-13T00:00:00", "email_address": "elena.popescu@gmail.com", "assigned_queue": "DFIR::phishing"}

It looks like it\u2019s from our payroll provider, but something feels off. The sender is \u201cpayroll-alerts@eu-paycenter[.]info\u201d and the subject says \u201cUpdate Your Payment Details for June Salary Processing.\u201d I double-checked with HR and they never use that address, plus the logo in the email is kind of pixelated and the signature just says \u201cEU Payroll Services Team\u201d (no names or anything).\n\nThe email claims there was a \u201cprocessing error\u201d with my bank details and says I need to \u201cconfirm your information to avoid delayed salary payment.\u201d There\u2019s a button labelled \u201cUpdate Account\u201d that links to hxxps://salary-confirm-eu[.]site/login (I replaced the dots). The message also has a PDF called \u201cPayrollNotice2024.pdf\u201d attached, but I haven\u2019t opened it just in case. \n\nI haven\u2019t clicked anything and no one else in my section has reported similar emails yet. Can you check if this is part of a new phishing campaign? Should we warn staff?\n\nThanks for your help,\n\nAnita Popescu\nAdministrative Assistant\nEuropean Parliament", "created_date": "2024-05-22T00:00:00", "email_address": "anita.popescu@europarl.europa.eu", "assigned_queue": "DFIR::phishing"}
{"ticket_id": "TKT-43D2983B", "title": "ECB HR Platform: FastPDF Library Deserialization Vulnerability Identified in /hrdocs/generate Endpoint", "content": "Hi CERT-EU,\n\nI\u2019m reaching out from the IT Security Office at the European Central Bank. During our ongoing review of third-party dependencies in the ECB\u2019s internal HR platform, I noticed that the platform\u2019s backend relies on a version of the 'FastPDF' Java library (v3.2.1) which appears to have a deserialization vulnerability. Specifically, untrusted user input is passed directly to the PDF generation function without adequate sanitization, which could allow a crafted payload to trigger arbitrary code execution on the application server.\n\nI confirmed this risk by analyzing the library\u2019s changelog and cross-referencing with public CVE advisories, though I have not attempted active exploitation. The affected endpoint is /hrdocs/generate, which is only accessible internally, but given the platform\u2019s integration with other internal services, lateral movement might be possible if compromised.\n\nI\u2019ve attached a short write-up summarizing the issue, relevant stack traces, and links to the affected dependency. Please advise on your preferred disclosure timeline and if you need further technical details or a PoC. We\u2019re ready to coordinate patching efforts and will restrict access to the endpoint as a precaution.\n\nBest regards,\n\nDr. Lena Schreiber\nIT Security Analyst\nEuropean Central Bank\nlena.schreiber@ecb.europa.eu", "created_date": "2024-04-29T00:00:00", "email_address": "lena.schreiber@ecb.europa.eu", "assigned_queue": "OFFSEC::CVD"}

I\u2019m reaching out to check on the status of the purchase order we submitted last week for the replacement ID badge printers (SharpSecure-BP-5010 series) for our Brussels office. Our local support desk confirmed that the existing devices are failing more frequently\u2014yesterday we had to manually process six visitor badges due to repeated paper jams and print misalignments, which is not ideal given the current uptick in contractor onboarding.\n\nI\u2019ve attached the signed procurement form (signed_PO_SharpBP5010.pdf) as well as the vendor\u2019s updated quote (quote_SharpEU_0424.pdf) for your reference. Could you please confirm if the order has been approved and, if so, whether the expected delivery timeline still stands? The vendor indicated a possible delay due to a supply chain backlog, but I wanted to check if there\u2019s any update from your end or if you need further documentation to expedite the process. \n\nLet me know if you\u2019d prefer a quick call to clarify any details, or if I should loop in our facilities manager for logistics on installation. Thanks in advance for your help\u2014these printers are pretty critical for smooth daily access control.\n\nBest regards,\n\nLucas Moreau\nAdministrative Officer\nDG DIGIT, European Commission", "created_date": "2024-05-22T00:00:00", "email_address": "lucas.moreau@ec.europa.eu", "assigned_queue": "SMS"}

The subject line was \u201cImportant: Action Required for EU Grant Disbursement 2024\u201d.\n\nThe sender\u2019s address is grants-portal@eu-fundingalerts[.]eu, which isn\u2019t a domain I recognise from previous official comms. The message is formatted very similarly to the real notifications we get from the Funding & Tenders Portal (same blue banner, even the EU logo in the header), but the wording is a bit odd and there are a few minor typos. It asks us to \u2018validate the beneficiary account information\u2019 by clicking a button labeled \u201cReview Details\u201d.\n\nThe button links to hxxps://eu-fundingportal-verify[.]org/secure/login (I didn\u2019t click, just hovered to check). I\u2019m concerned this could be a phishing attempt targeting colleagues involved in grant management, as the timing coincides with the Q2 payment cycle. Two colleagues nearly clicked through before checking with me.\n\nI\u2019ve attached the original email as an .eml file, plus a screenshot of the message in Outlook. No one has entered any credentials as far as I know. We haven\u2019t seen any suspicious logins or account lockouts in our internal systems yet, but I wanted to flag this quickly in case other units or institutions are being targeted. Our IT support desk is also aware and monitoring for similar reports.\n\nCould you confirm if this is a known campaign or something new? Do you need any more info from our side (headers, logs, etc.)? Let me know if you want me to circulate a warning to the rest of our department or if CERT-EU will handle broader comms. Happy to provide anything else you need.\n\nThanks for your help,\n\nBest regards,\n\nNicolas Dumont\nProgramme Assistant \u2013 Grants Administration\nDG TAXUD\nEuropean Commission\nnicolas.dumont@ec.europa.eu", "created_date": "2024-01-03T00:00:00", "email_address": "nicolas.dumont@ec.europa.eu", "assigned_queue": "DFIR::phishing"}
