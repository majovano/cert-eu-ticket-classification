{"ticket_id": "TKT-528439F7", "title": "Citizen Report: Suspicious 'EU eID Support' Email Requesting Digital ID Renewal", "content": "Hi CERT-EU,\n\nSorry for the direct forward, but I just got this weird email on my personal mailbox and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s something you want to know about. The message says it\u2019s from \u201cEU eID Support\u201d and tells me my digital ID card is about to expire, with a big blue button to \u201crenew credentials.\u201d The sender address is eidsupport@eu-idrenewal[.]org (which doesn\u2019t look right to me?).\n\nI almost clicked the button but noticed the link (hxxps://eu-idportal[.]org/renew-now) doesn\u2019t match the official site I used before. The email has a logo that looks like the one on the real eID site, but the text is a bit off and there\u2019s a typo in my surname. No attachments, just the button and a note saying my \u201cEU access may be restricted.\u201d\n\nNot sure if this is something you track for citizens or just staff, but figured I\u2019d send it over just in case. Let me know if you need the full message or headers (I\u2019m not sure how to get those but can try).\n\nThanks,\n\nElena Popescu", "created_date": "2025-06-13T00:00:00", "email_address": "elena.popescu@gmail.com", "assigned_queue": "DFIR::phishing"}
{"ticket_id": "TKT-17472FB5", "title": "Payroll Phishing Attempt Impersonating EU Salary Processing \u2013 Staff Advisory Needed", "content": "Hello CERT-EU DFIR,\n\nI'm flagging a weird message that landed in my Parliament mailbox this morning. It looks like it\u2019s from our payroll provider, but something feels off. The sender is \u201cpayroll-alerts@eu-paycenter[.]info\u201d and the subject says \u201cUpdate Your Payment Details for June Salary Processing.\u201d I double-checked with HR and they never use that address, plus the logo in the email is kind of pixelated and the signature just says \u201cEU Payroll Services Team\u201d (no names or anything).\n\nThe email claims there was a \u201cprocessing error\u201d with my bank details and says I need to \u201cconfirm your information to avoid delayed salary payment.\u201d There\u2019s a button labelled \u201cUpdate Account\u201d that links to hxxps://salary-confirm-eu[.]site/login (I replaced the dots). The message also has a PDF called \u201cPayrollNotice2024.pdf\u201d attached, but I haven\u2019t opened it just in case. \n\nI haven\u2019t clicked anything and no one else in my section has reported similar emails yet. Can you check if this is part of a new phishing campaign? Should we warn staff?\n\nThanks for your help,\n\nAnita Popescu\nAdministrative Assistant\nEuropean Parliament", "created_date": "2024-05-22T00:00:00", "email_address": "anita.popescu@europarl.europa.eu", "assigned_queue": "DFIR::phishing"}
