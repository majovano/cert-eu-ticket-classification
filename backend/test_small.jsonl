{"ticket_id": "TKT-F3DDE96A", "title": "OAuth Redirect URI Validation Flaw in Third-Party Analytics Integration \u2013 Vulnerability Disclosure", "content": "Dear CERT-EU Vulnerability Disclosure Team,\n\nI am reaching out from the European Investment Bank\u2019s IT Security Office to report a potential vulnerability uncovered during our recent integration of a third-party data analytics platform with our internal CRM system (hosted at hxxps://crm-internal.eib[.]europa[.]eu). Specifically, we observed that the analytics tool\u2019s OAuth implementation does not properly validate redirect URIs, which could allow for an open redirect or even token interception if exploited. \n\nThe issue was initially detected on 3 July 2024, while testing custom dashboards for investment optimization. Our security logs indicate that the analytics tool accepts arbitrary redirect_uri parameters during the OAuth flow, enabling an attacker to potentially capture access tokens by redirecting users to a malicious endpoint. No exploitation has been observed so far, but the risk is considerable given the sensitivity of investment data processed by the CRM.\n\nWe have attached a technical report (oauth_redirect_validation_issue.pdf) detailing our findings, including step-by-step reproduction instructions and sample HTTP requests. In line with NIS2 and GDPR compliance, we have temporarily restricted integrations with the affected analytics platform pending further investigation.\n\nWe request CERT-EU\u2019s guidance on coordinated disclosure to the vendor and any recommendations for immediate risk mitigation. Please let us know if additional logs or technical details are required. We are open to joint validation and further collaboration.\n\nBest regards,\n\nIsabelle Laurent\nSenior Security Analyst\nIT Security Office, European Investment Bank", "created_date": "2024-11-16", "email_address": "isabelle.laurent@eib.europa.eu", "assigned_queue": "OFFSEC::CVD"}
{"ticket_id": "TKT-D3421FF9", "title": "Based Malware Detected on JRC Lab Workstation \u2013 Risk of Project Data Exposure", "content": "Subject: [FWD] Suspicious PowerShell Activity and Possible Malware Infection on Shared Research Workstation\n\nHi CERT-EU DFIR,\n\nForwarding the below from our IT team as requested \u2013 I\u2019m not sure how much of this is relevant, but we\u2019ve had a weird situation this afternoon on one of our main research workstations in the lab (hostname: bio-analyt05.jrc.it).\n\nAround 13:30 CEST, several colleagues noticed the machine running unusually slow and displaying multiple command prompt windows briefly flashing on the screen. One user (Dr. Conti) reported that her session terminated unexpectedly and she was logged out, even though she hadn\u2019t touched anything.\n\nOur local IT support checked the system and found a PowerShell script executing from C:\\Users\\Public\\lib\\update_cache.ps1, which is not something we recognize or have deployed. The process tree (from Sysmon) shows the script being launched by a parent process called msedge.exe, which I guess is the Edge browser? We don\u2019t normally allow Edge to run scripts, so that\u2019s odd.\n\nIn the event logs, there are multiple entries for outbound connections to IP 217.160.48.119 over TCP/8088, initiated by PowerShell. The script itself tries to download a file named update.exe from hxxp://cdn-eu1[.]fileshare[.]eu/downloads/ and then creates a scheduled task called \u201cCacheUpdater\u201d.\n\nWe immediately disconnected the workstation from the lab network and ran a basic AV scan (Windows Defender), which detected \u2018Trojan:Win32/Emotet.B\u2019 and quarantined update.exe, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the end of it. No other workstations in the immediate vicinity are showing alerts yet, but I\u2019m worried about lateral movement or data loss. The shared folder D:\\Projects\\EU-BioData\\ is accessible from this host and contains project files for the EU-wide research collaboration, some of which are confidential.\n\nWe\u2019ve collected relevant logs (Sysmon, Windows Event Viewer, Defender logs), and I\u2019m attaching a sample here (\u2018bio-analyt05_logs_20240715.zip\u2019). Our IT said they saw attempts to create new local user accounts (user: temp_svc) right before we unplugged the device.\n\nWe\u2019re not sure how the script got there \u2013 Dr. Conti mentioned she downloaded a PDF from an external conference site earlier in the day, but nothing looked suspicious. No suspicious emails reported either.\n\nPlease advise on next steps: should we reimage the workstation? Do we need to scan other lab PCs, or notify project partners? We\u2019re a bit out of our depth on this, so any help is appreciated. Let us know if you need more details or remote access.\n\nThanks in advance for your help,\n\nBest,\n\nSara Bellini\nLab Coordinator\nJoint Research Centre (JRC) \u2013 Ispra, Italy\nsara.bellini@jrc.it", "created_date": "2024-10-11T00:00:00", "email_address": "sara.bellini@jrc.it", "assigned_queue": "DFIR::incidents"}
{"ticket_id": "TKT-1F0F8415", "title": "Delivery Issues with Secure Invitations for Cybersecurity Onboarding \u2013 Administrative Guidance Needed", "content": "Dear CERT-EU Administrative & HR Team,\n\nI am writing on behalf of the European Parliament\u2019s Cybersecurity Awareness Programme regarding the upcoming onboarding session for new staff within the Information Security Directorate. We have recently identified that several training invitations sent via our secure messaging platform (internal SMS gateway) were not successfully delivered to a subset of external contractors and seconded national experts, particularly those whose mobile numbers are registered outside Belgium.\n\nAs you are aware, participation in the initial cybersecurity awareness module is a mandatory component of the onboarding process, in line with both the European Parliament\u2019s internal policy and the NIS2 Directive\u2019s training requirements. Our records indicate that approximately 18 invitees did not receive their secure SMS links, which contain unique authentication tokens granting access to the e-learning portal. We have already cross-checked the affected numbers against our HR database and verified that the mobile contacts are accurate and active.\n\nTo ensure full compliance and avoid any delays in the onboarding schedule, could you please advise on the following administrative points:\n\n1. Are there any current restrictions or known issues with the SMS gateway when sending secure messages to international mobile numbers, especially those with non-EU country codes?\n2. Would it be possible to resend the invitations via an alternative channel (e.g., institutional email with secure link), and if so, are there any additional compliance steps required from the HR side?\n3. Is there a standard reporting template for documenting such delivery failures as part of our NIS2 compliance log? If so, kindly provide a copy or direct me to the relevant SharePoint location.\n\nFor your reference, I have attached the latest delivery report (see 'SMS_AwarenessDeliveryLog_20240619.xlsx', defanged) which lists the impacted users and associated error codes. If you require further details or a follow-up call, please let me know your availability this week. Our goal is to ensure that all new staff are able to complete their required cybersecurity training prior to system access being granted.\n\nThank you in advance for your assistance and guidance.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMartina Keller\nHR Liaison \u2013 Cybersecurity Awareness\nDirectorate-General for Personnel\nEuropean Parliament\n\nAttachment: SMS_AwarenessDeliveryLog_20240619.xlsx", "created_date": "2025-01-05", "email_address": "martina.keller@europarl.europa.eu", "assigned_queue": "SMS"}
