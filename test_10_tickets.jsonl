During our ongoing review of third-party dependencies in the ECB\u2019s internal HR platform, I noticed that the platform\u2019s backend relies on a version of the 'FastPDF' Java library (v3.2.1) which appears to have a deserialization vulnerability. Specifically, untrusted user input is passed directly to the PDF generation function without adequate sanitization, which could allow a crafted payload to trigger arbitrary code execution on the application server.\n\nI confirmed this risk by analyzing the library\u2019s changelog and cross-referencing with public CVE advisories, though I have not attempted active exploitation. The affected endpoint is /hrdocs/generate, which is only accessible internally, but given the platform\u2019s integration with other internal services, lateral movement might be possible if compromised.\n\nI\u2019ve attached a short write-up summarizing the issue, relevant stack traces, and links to the affected dependency. Please advise on your preferred disclosure timeline and if you need further technical details or a PoC.

Last night, our automated security scripts\u2014scheduled to validate the resilience of our forecast data ingestion servers against simulated lateral movement\u2014failed to trigger the expected updates within the investment data module. This anomaly persisted despite multiple manual restarts of the relevant virtual machines (VMs) and confirmation that our test agent maintained connectivity with the primary data source.\n\nWe suspect that a recent change in network segmentation or a possible misconfiguration of security controls (firewall or NAC policies) may be blocking the test scripts' ability to access the backend data processing cluster.

Over the weekend, our SOC at the Belgian Federal Public Service for Digitalisation (FOD BOSA) picked up a cluster of anomalous authentication failures and session hijacks against the national eIDAS node. The activity spiked between 03:20 and 04:15 UTC on 16 June, coinciding with a surge in failed SAML assertions from IPs not previously seen in our logs (sample: 37.120.144[.]22, 2a02:2f0e:2::f3b2).\n\nInitial triage by our team found what looks like a previously undocumented exploit chain targeting the SAML processing module (no CVE yet). The attacker appears to manipulate assertion attributes to bypass signature validation, resulting in privilege escalation for arbitrary users. We\u2019ve included relevant log extracts and a PCAP snippet in the attached ZIP (password: eid2024!). Also, the attacker\u2019s requests contained a custom User-Agent string: \"Go-http-client/2.1 (eidas-bypass)\", which doesn\u2019t match any legitimate integration partners.\n\nWe\u2019re still digging, but there\u2019s a strong suspicion this could be part of a broader campaign against EU cross-border authentication systems. No evidence of data exfiltration so far, but the TTPs overlap with those described in the \"Starlake\" actor profile (notably MITRE ATT&CK T1606.001 \u2013 Forge Web Credentials). Attribution confidence is low at this stage, but the infrastructure seems to be bouncing through Eastern European VPS providers.\n\nCould you please check if similar activity has been flagged by other Member State eIDAS operators?

Over the past 48 hours, our team observed a sharp and unexplained drop in user interactions and engagement metrics on the official 'EU Voices' portal (euvoices.consilium.europa.eu), which serves as a primary channel for citizen feedback on EU initiatives.\n\nInitial checks by our communications staff did not reveal any changes to campaign content or targeting settings that would account for the sudden decline. However, following a tip from our web analytics vendor, our IT staff reviewed the backend logs and noticed several anomalous HTTP POST requests originating from multiple external IPs (e.g., 212.83.140.55, 91.198.174.192). These requests targeted the campaign feedback submission endpoint and included suspiciously crafted payloads with embedded SQL syntax (e.g., ' OR 1=1 --) and user agents mimicking outdated browsers.\n\nOur web application firewall (WAF) flagged several of these requests as potential SQL injection attempts between 19 and 21 June 2024. Below is a sample log extract for your reference:\n\n[WAF log] 2024-06-20T22:18:47Z | src_ip=212.83.140.55 | url=/submit-feedback | method=POST | payload=' OR 1=1 -- | user_agent=Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)'\n\nWhile there is no direct evidence yet of successful data exfiltration, we are concerned that the incident may have affected the reliability of the engagement metrics and possibly compromised the confidentiality of citizen-submitted feedback. Our team has implemented temporary filtering rules on the WAF and blocked the most active source IPs, but we lack the forensic capacity to fully assess whether any unauthorized queries succeeded or if further lateral movement occurred.\n\nWe are treating this as an ongoing investigation and have preserved relevant WAF, application, and database logs (attached as 'euvoices_waf-logs-20240621.zip'). We kindly request CERT-EU's assistance in:\n- Conducting a forensic review of the affected endpoints for signs of compromise\n- Correlating any identified IOCs with known threat actor activity\n- Advising on containment, remediation, and notification obligations under NIS2/GDPR if citizen data is confirmed to be at risk\n\nPlease let us know if you require additional information or direct access to the affected systems.
