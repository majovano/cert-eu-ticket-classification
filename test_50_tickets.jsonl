Over the past 48 hours, our team observed a sharp and unexplained drop in user interactions and engagement metrics on the official 'EU Voices' portal (euvoices.consilium.europa.eu), which serves as a primary channel for citizen feedback on EU initiatives.\n\nInitial checks by our communications staff did not reveal any changes to campaign content or targeting settings that would account for the sudden decline. However, following a tip from our web analytics vendor, our IT staff reviewed the backend logs and noticed several anomalous HTTP POST requests originating from multiple external IPs (e.g., 212.83.140.55, 91.198.174.192). These requests targeted the campaign feedback submission endpoint and included suspiciously crafted payloads with embedded SQL syntax (e.g., ' OR 1=1 --) and user agents mimicking outdated browsers.\n\nOur web application firewall (WAF) flagged several of these requests as potential SQL injection attempts between 19 and 21 June 2024.

While auditing the mobile app 'EuroSecure Connect' (Android v3.7.12, package: eu.euconnect.mobile) for my thesis, I stumbled across a potential insecure direct object reference (IDOR) issue affecting user profile exports. Basically, by intercepting traffic with Burp Suite, I noticed the endpoint /api/v2/profile/export accepts arbitrary user IDs without checking session tokens properly. As a result, I could access profile data (email, org affiliation, photo) of other users, just by swapping the id parameter\u2014see attached screenshots.\n\nThis was tested using test accounts only, not real user data.

The link, which I have defanged here, is hxxps://ecb-digitalid[.]eu-secure[.]org/verify. The message claims this verification is mandatory due to \"new EU-wide digital identity compliance regulations\" and threatens \"limited access to digital services\" if not completed within 48 hours.

The alert was triggered after a routine policy compliance scan detected new global admin assignments to two service accounts (svc_graphapi1, svc_deploybot2) that do NOT normally require such rights. These changes originated from a user session attributed to \"m.petrosyan@ecdc.europa.eu\"\u2014a legitimate admin, but the timing and context look off.\n\nNotable findings:\n- The admin role assignments occurred from an IP address in Vilnius (85.206.123.45), which is not in the usual geo-fence for our cloud admins (typically Stockholm or Brussels).\n- Azure AD sign-in logs show a failed MFA attempt for m.petrosyan about 30 seconds before the successful login.\n- Immediately after, multiple Azure Resource Manager (ARM) deployments were kicked off, including a template referencing a previously unseen storage account (ecdc-logs-temp).\n- Our EDR (Defender for Cloud) flagged an unusual PowerShell execution on the admin\u2019s workstation, launching Connect-AzAccount with the \u2013UseDeviceAuthentication flag\u2014something we rarely see internally.\n\nActions so far:\n- Revoked all active sessions for m.petrosyan and the affected service accounts.\n- Rolled back the suspicious role assignments and temporarily disabled programmatic access to the subscription.\n- Notified our DPO as a precaution\u2014no confirmed data leakage, but we\u2019re still pulling activity logs for exfil signs.\n- Collected full [AzureADSignIns.csv], relevant [activitylog.json], and Defender for Cloud alerts (see attached: ecdc_azure_incident_20240617.zip).\n\nQuestions/Assistance Needed:\n- Can you assist in reviewing whether this was a targeted phishing attempt or token theft?

There were repeated attempts to contact an external domain (hxxp://europeanalytica[.]org/download/klip32.dll) over port 443, which is not a whitelisted research endpoint. The hash for the dropped DLL (SHA256: 51a7c2a3b6a1d4...) doesn\u2019t match anything in our current threat feeds or the VirusTotal DB as of 14:05. Below is a relevant EDR alert excerpt:\n\n[Defender Alert ID: 478393]\nTimestamp: 2024-07-11 13:34:52 CEST\nProcess: rundll32.exe\nUser: user_bartoli\nNetwork: Outbound to 185.244.25.61:443\n\nWe\u2019ve quarantined the affected device and revoked the user\u2019s credentials, but we\u2019re still seeing similar beaconing attempts from two other lab workstations (jrc-labws-11, jrc-labws-22) within the same subnet. This suggests lateral movement, possibly via shared mapped drives. No evidence yet of data exfiltration, but we\u2019re still pulling network logs and traffic captures.\n\nWe\u2019re short-staffed and need CERT-EU\u2019s help with rapid triage, memory forensics, and advice on further containment, especially as these machines have access to sensitive research datasets. I\u2019ve attached the full EDR alert bundle and a pcap sample to this ticket (see \u2018jrc-malware-jul11.zip\u2019).\n\nLet me know if you want the AD logs or additional workstation images.

My team at the University of Pavia\u2019s Department of Computer Engineering recently completed an in-depth analysis of the EuroScience Grant Portal (https://grants.euroscience-platform.eu), specifically its application review module.\n\nDuring a controlled test (no production data accessed or modified), we discovered evidence of an insecure deserialization flaw in the handling of serialized user profile objects within the /api/reviewer/upload endpoint. The endpoint accepts a base64-encoded payload parameter named \"profile_data\" which, after minimal fuzzing, was found to be unserialized directly by the backend Java service without adequate validation or type restriction. Our proof-of-concept payload (details in attached report) demonstrates that arbitrary Java objects can be injected, which could potentially allow a remote attacker to achieve remote code execution or escalate privileges within the application context.\n\nTo clarify, we did not attempt to exploit this beyond the test user account provisioned for the research project. All payloads were designed to confirm deserialization behaviour and did not impact the integrity or confidentiality of real user data. However, the risk associated with this class of vulnerability is significant, especially considering the sensitive nature of applicant information processed by the portal.\n\nKey technical observations:\n- Endpoint: POST https://grants.euroscience-platform.eu/api/reviewer/upload\n- Parameter: profile_data (base64-encoded serialized Java object)\n- No evidence of input validation or class whitelisting prior to deserialization\n- Application appears to use Apache Commons Collections 3.2.1 (vulnerable to known gadget chains)\n\nI have attached a detailed technical write-up (PDF) including the PoC, request/response samples, and recommended mitigation strategies (e.g., implementation of a safe serialization framework or input whitelisting). We are submitting this disclosure in accordance with CERT-EU\u2019s coordinated vulnerability disclosure policy and the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity\u2019s responsible research guidelines.\n\nWe would appreciate feedback regarding the preferred remediation and disclosure timeline, and are happy to collaborate with both CERT-EU and the relevant system maintainers for further validation or mitigation testing.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.

As you know, we kicked off the engagement on 8 July, and our IT security team has been monitoring the test activities closely as per our joint protocol (ref: ECA-PT-2024-07).\n\nEarlier today (11 July, approx. 10:25 CET), our SIEM (Splunk Enterprise) generated several high-severity alerts related to anomalous SMB traffic targeting the finance subnet (10.12.34.0/24). Specifically, we observed repeated authentication attempts against the ECA-FIN-APPSRV01 file server using non-existent user accounts (e.g., svc_test01, audit-temp, and backupuser_old). The attempts originated from the test workstation (172.21.8.44), which matches the IP range you provided in the engagement scope document. We also noticed a short spike in CPU utilization on the server and a couple of temporary account lockouts, though no legitimate users were affected.\n\nOur concern is mainly around the timing: the finance team had a scheduled data import running, and a few users reported minor slowdowns accessing shared folders. No data corruption or access errors have been reported, but the team is a bit anxious given the criticality of these systems, especially during the monthly reconciliation process.\n\nCould you please confirm if these authentication attempts and the associated activity are part of your planned lateral movement and password spraying scenarios? If so, would it be possible to coordinate such tests outside of core business hours in the future to minimize operational impact?

This incident was first detected on 10/07/2024 at approximately 14:40 CET by our internal SOC, following alerts from our SIEM (Elastic Stack) regarding anomalous API activity and possible data exfiltration attempts.\n\nSummary of Incident:\n- Over a 90-minute window, we observed an unusual spike in outbound API requests from the service account 'svc_collab_mgr', which is typically restricted to workflow automation tasks. These requests included large volume exports of project task data, user messaging logs, and attached files\u2014far exceeding normal operational patterns.\n- The source IP addresses (primarily 178.62.85.199 and 37.120.156.48) are not associated with our internal VPN or trusted partners. Geolocation suggests Eastern Europe, which is outside our expected user base.\n- SIEM correlation identified multiple failed login attempts against privileged user accounts ('pm_admin', 'sg_projectlead') immediately prior to the API activity, followed by a successful authentication for 'svc_collab_mgr' from the above IPs.\n- Review of [audit.log] and [access.log] (extracts attached) shows API tokens were issued to 'svc_collab_mgr' without a corresponding interactive login event, raising suspicion of token theft or abuse of compromised credentials.\n- No signs of ransomware or destructive actions have been observed so far. However, some sensitive project documents (marked as restricted under our internal data classification policy) were among the files exported.\n\nImmediate Actions Taken:\n- The affected service account and all related API tokens have been revoked as of 16:05 CET.\n- We have temporarily disabled external integrations (e.g., with Office365 and Slack) pending further investigation.\n- Forensic snapshots of the relevant cloud containers and user sessions have been preserved for CERT-EU review.\n- Data Protection and Legal Affairs have been notified to assess potential GDPR/NIS2 notification requirements.\n\nAssistance Requested:\n- We request CERT-EU\u2019s support in forensic analysis to confirm the vector of compromise (credential theft, session hijack, or API vulnerability) and to determine the extent of any data exfiltration.\n- Recommendations for improving API security, including token management and monitoring, would be appreciated.\n- Please advise if you require additional logs, memory dumps, or direct access to the affected cloud environment.\n\nThis incident may have implications for inter-DG project collaboration and could affect ongoing workstreams if sensitive information was accessed by unauthorised parties.

Over the past week, our automated monitoring at the European Parliament has picked up outbound DNS queries to a cluster of domains that don\u2019t match any of our sanctioned SaaS providers. Most of these domains are subdomains of \u201csyncdash-portal[.]net\u201d and resolve to rotating IPs in Eastern Europe. Our Splunk dashboard correlates these with sudden spikes in encrypted outbound traffic from several internal HR workstations (see attached CSV for full list of affected hosts and timestamps).\n\nWe haven\u2019t seen any malware alerts or endpoint detections, but the traffic patterns started right after a LinkedIn-themed phishing wave last Monday. No users have reported issues, but the DNS tunneling signatures are similar to what we saw during last year\u2019s \u201cSilverCrane\u201d campaign (T1071.004, T1568.002). \n\nCan you check if these indicators match any ongoing infrastructure tracking or recent threat actor activity in your datasets? We\u2019re treating this as a routine intelligence update for now, but happy to provide Zeek logs or further details if needed.\n\nBest,\n\nElena Petrova\nSOC Automation System\nEuropean Parliament\nsoc-automation@europarl.europa.eu", "created_date": "2024-10-26T00:00:00", "email_address": "soc-automation@europarl.europa.eu", "assigned_queue": "CTI"}

We\u2019ve noticed an uptick in suspicious traffic patterns affecting several endpoints at the European Medicines Agency (EMA) over the past 48 hours. Our EDR flagged outbound connections to a cluster of previously unseen domains, and after some triage, we believe this activity may be linked to a new C2 infrastructure attributed to the actor group known as \"OrchidWasp\" (see ENISA sectoral threat brief 2024-07-02 for context).\n\nHere\u2019s a quick summary of what we\u2019ve observed:\n- Multiple workstations in the Regulatory Affairs department initiated TLS sessions to domains with similar registration patterns (e.g., medsecure-track[.]com, pharmlogistics[.]info). None of these domains have prior reputation in our threat feeds.\n- Outbound traffic began at 03:12 CET on 3 July, correlating with a batch of suspicious DLL sideloading alerts (CrowdStrike Falcon flagged T1574.002).\n- Reverse DNS on the C2 endpoints resolves to subnets previously referenced in OrchidWasp\u2019s 2023 campaign targeting EU public health entities, but with updated infrastructure (see attached IOC CSV for full details).\n- Attached is a zipped MISP export (ema_orchidwasp_iocs_20240703.zip, TLP:AMBER) containing:\n  * 3 new domains (defanged)\n  * 2 SHA256 hashes of DLL payloads (no VT hits as of this morning)\n  * Extracted C2 IPs and associated WHOIS data\n  * Timeline of beaconing activity\n\nWe\u2019re currently working with our internal IT and Digital Transformation teams to block the identified indicators and conduct a wider sweep for lateral movement. However, we lack visibility into whether this infrastructure overlaps with ongoing OrchidWasp campaigns elsewhere in the EU, or if this is a new variant.\n\nCould you please assist with:\n- Cross-referencing these IOCs against your current CTI holdings for OrchidWasp or related actor clusters\n- Any enrichment on the domains or payloads, especially if you\u2019ve seen similar TTPs (DLL sideloading, living-off-the-land binaries, staged C2 setup)\n- Recommendations for sector-wide notification or further investigation steps\n\nApologies for the quick turnaround\u2014our management is pushing for a coordinated response, but we want to avoid unnecessary alarm if this is isolated.

Our research group at the University of Tartu noticed several new listings on two Tor forums advertising access to EU government endpoints. The sellers claim to have RDP credentials for various .eu domains, and included screenshots referencing \u2018octopus-proxy[.]eu\u2019 as their access broker.\n\nOur team traced several of the C2 panel login pages (hxxp://octpnl3x[.]onion, hxxp://eu-gov-check[.]onion) to the same hosting provider in Moldova, active since mid-May. We\u2019ve extracted a handful of BTC addresses and Telegram handles linked to these listings, which we believe are associated with the FIN12 group (confidence moderate, based on reused PGP keys and similar TTPs as in MISP event #5421).\n\nWe\u2019ve attached a CSV of IOCs (onion URLs, BTC wallets, Telegram IDs, registration emails) and some screenshots. If you have insight into any infrastructure overlap with ongoing ransomware or credential broker campaigns, or can confirm attribution, please share.

{"ticket_id": "TKT-0DE823DB", "title": "Arbitrary File Upload Vulnerability in Analytics Data Ingestion Pipeline (EIB Platform", "content": "Dear CERT-EU Vulnerability Coordination Team,\n\nI am writing on behalf of the Investment Operations Unit at the European Investment Bank (EIB) to report a recently identified vulnerability in our analytics data ingestion workflow, discovered during a routine system integration review. This disclosure is submitted under the Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) policy and in alignment with NIS2 obligations.\n\nWhile integrating a new market trend analysis module into our existing investment analytics platform, we observed that the backend data processing pipeline (hosted at hxxps://analytics-backend[.]eib[.]int) is inadvertently exposing a misconfigured file upload endpoint. Specifically, the endpoint at /api/v2/upload-analytics accepts arbitrary file types without adequate content validation or authentication checks. Our internal testing demonstrated that it is possible to upload files containing embedded scripts or executable code, which are subsequently processed by the analytics engine with elevated privileges. This could potentially allow a remote attacker to achieve code execution within the analytics container, manipulate market trend data, or pivot laterally within the infrastructure.\n\nWe have attached a technical report (see: EIB_Analytics_UploadVuln.pdf) containing proof-of-concept payloads, affected request samples, and a high-level risk analysis. At this stage, no exploitation beyond controlled testing has occurred, and no sensitive data was accessed or modified. Our assessment suggests that this vulnerability could be leveraged for both data integrity attacks and broader compromise, especially if chained with other misconfigurations or exposed credentials.\n\nGiven the criticality of accurate analytics for investment risk management and regulatory reporting, we recommend prioritising a review of the upload endpoint and implementing strict file type validation, authentication, and sandboxing for all user-supplied data. Please advise on preferred timelines for coordinated remediation and public disclosure, as well as any additional information you require from our technical team.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter. We are available for further discussion and can provide additional logs or participate in joint validation if needed.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMateusz Kowalski\nIT Security Analyst, Investment Operations Unit\nEuropean Investment Bank", "created_date": "2024-03-22", "email_address": "mateusz.kowalski@eib.europa.eu", "assigned_queue": "OFFSEC::CVD", "original_queue": "Customer Service"}
