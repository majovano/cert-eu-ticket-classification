Over the past 48 hours, our team observed a sharp and unexplained drop in user interactions and engagement metrics on the official 'EU Voices' portal (euvoices.consilium.europa.eu), which serves as a primary channel for citizen feedback on EU initiatives.\n\nInitial checks by our communications staff did not reveal any changes to campaign content or targeting settings that would account for the sudden decline. However, following a tip from our web analytics vendor, our IT staff reviewed the backend logs and noticed several anomalous HTTP POST requests originating from multiple external IPs (e.g., 212.83.140.55, 91.198.174.192). These requests targeted the campaign feedback submission endpoint and included suspiciously crafted payloads with embedded SQL syntax (e.g., ' OR 1=1 --) and user agents mimicking outdated browsers.\n\nOur web application firewall (WAF) flagged several of these requests as potential SQL injection attempts between 19 and 21 June 2024.

While auditing the mobile app 'EuroSecure Connect' (Android v3.7.12, package: eu.euconnect.mobile) for my thesis, I stumbled across a potential insecure direct object reference (IDOR) issue affecting user profile exports. Basically, by intercepting traffic with Burp Suite, I noticed the endpoint /api/v2/profile/export accepts arbitrary user IDs without checking session tokens properly. As a result, I could access profile data (email, org affiliation, photo) of other users, just by swapping the id parameter\u2014see attached screenshots.\n\nThis was tested using test accounts only, not real user data.

The link, which I have defanged here, is hxxps://ecb-digitalid[.]eu-secure[.]org/verify. The message claims this verification is mandatory due to \"new EU-wide digital identity compliance regulations\" and threatens \"limited access to digital services\" if not completed within 48 hours.

The alert was triggered after a routine policy compliance scan detected new global admin assignments to two service accounts (svc_graphapi1, svc_deploybot2) that do NOT normally require such rights. These changes originated from a user session attributed to \"m.petrosyan@ecdc.europa.eu\"\u2014a legitimate admin, but the timing and context look off.\n\nNotable findings:\n- The admin role assignments occurred from an IP address in Vilnius (85.206.123.45), which is not in the usual geo-fence for our cloud admins (typically Stockholm or Brussels).\n- Azure AD sign-in logs show a failed MFA attempt for m.petrosyan about 30 seconds before the successful login.\n- Immediately after, multiple Azure Resource Manager (ARM) deployments were kicked off, including a template referencing a previously unseen storage account (ecdc-logs-temp).\n- Our EDR (Defender for Cloud) flagged an unusual PowerShell execution on the admin\u2019s workstation, launching Connect-AzAccount with the \u2013UseDeviceAuthentication flag\u2014something we rarely see internally.\n\nActions so far:\n- Revoked all active sessions for m.petrosyan and the affected service accounts.\n- Rolled back the suspicious role assignments and temporarily disabled programmatic access to the subscription.\n- Notified our DPO as a precaution\u2014no confirmed data leakage, but we\u2019re still pulling activity logs for exfil signs.\n- Collected full [AzureADSignIns.csv], relevant [activitylog.json], and Defender for Cloud alerts (see attached: ecdc_azure_incident_20240617.zip).\n\nQuestions/Assistance Needed:\n- Can you assist in reviewing whether this was a targeted phishing attempt or token theft?

There were repeated attempts to contact an external domain (hxxp://europeanalytica[.]org/download/klip32.dll) over port 443, which is not a whitelisted research endpoint. The hash for the dropped DLL (SHA256: 51a7c2a3b6a1d4...) doesn\u2019t match anything in our current threat feeds or the VirusTotal DB as of 14:05. Below is a relevant EDR alert excerpt:\n\n[Defender Alert ID: 478393]\nTimestamp: 2024-07-11 13:34:52 CEST\nProcess: rundll32.exe\nUser: user_bartoli\nNetwork: Outbound to 185.244.25.61:443\n\nWe\u2019ve quarantined the affected device and revoked the user\u2019s credentials, but we\u2019re still seeing similar beaconing attempts from two other lab workstations (jrc-labws-11, jrc-labws-22) within the same subnet. This suggests lateral movement, possibly via shared mapped drives. No evidence yet of data exfiltration, but we\u2019re still pulling network logs and traffic captures.\n\nWe\u2019re short-staffed and need CERT-EU\u2019s help with rapid triage, memory forensics, and advice on further containment, especially as these machines have access to sensitive research datasets. I\u2019ve attached the full EDR alert bundle and a pcap sample to this ticket (see \u2018jrc-malware-jul11.zip\u2019).\n\nLet me know if you want the AD logs or additional workstation images.

My team at the University of Pavia\u2019s Department of Computer Engineering recently completed an in-depth analysis of the EuroScience Grant Portal (https://grants.euroscience-platform.eu), specifically its application review module.\n\nDuring a controlled test (no production data accessed or modified), we discovered evidence of an insecure deserialization flaw in the handling of serialized user profile objects within the /api/reviewer/upload endpoint. The endpoint accepts a base64-encoded payload parameter named \"profile_data\" which, after minimal fuzzing, was found to be unserialized directly by the backend Java service without adequate validation or type restriction. Our proof-of-concept payload (details in attached report) demonstrates that arbitrary Java objects can be injected, which could potentially allow a remote attacker to achieve remote code execution or escalate privileges within the application context.\n\nTo clarify, we did not attempt to exploit this beyond the test user account provisioned for the research project. All payloads were designed to confirm deserialization behaviour and did not impact the integrity or confidentiality of real user data. However, the risk associated with this class of vulnerability is significant, especially considering the sensitive nature of applicant information processed by the portal.\n\nKey technical observations:\n- Endpoint: POST https://grants.euroscience-platform.eu/api/reviewer/upload\n- Parameter: profile_data (base64-encoded serialized Java object)\n- No evidence of input validation or class whitelisting prior to deserialization\n- Application appears to use Apache Commons Collections 3.2.1 (vulnerable to known gadget chains)\n\nI have attached a detailed technical write-up (PDF) including the PoC, request/response samples, and recommended mitigation strategies (e.g., implementation of a safe serialization framework or input whitelisting). We are submitting this disclosure in accordance with CERT-EU\u2019s coordinated vulnerability disclosure policy and the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity\u2019s responsible research guidelines.\n\nWe would appreciate feedback regarding the preferred remediation and disclosure timeline, and are happy to collaborate with both CERT-EU and the relevant system maintainers for further validation or mitigation testing.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.

As you know, we kicked off the engagement on 8 July, and our IT security team has been monitoring the test activities closely as per our joint protocol (ref: ECA-PT-2024-07).\n\nEarlier today (11 July, approx. 10:25 CET), our SIEM (Splunk Enterprise) generated several high-severity alerts related to anomalous SMB traffic targeting the finance subnet (10.12.34.0/24). Specifically, we observed repeated authentication attempts against the ECA-FIN-APPSRV01 file server using non-existent user accounts (e.g., svc_test01, audit-temp, and backupuser_old). The attempts originated from the test workstation (172.21.8.44), which matches the IP range you provided in the engagement scope document. We also noticed a short spike in CPU utilization on the server and a couple of temporary account lockouts, though no legitimate users were affected.\n\nOur concern is mainly around the timing: the finance team had a scheduled data import running, and a few users reported minor slowdowns accessing shared folders. No data corruption or access errors have been reported, but the team is a bit anxious given the criticality of these systems, especially during the monthly reconciliation process.\n\nCould you please confirm if these authentication attempts and the associated activity are part of your planned lateral movement and password spraying scenarios? If so, would it be possible to coordinate such tests outside of core business hours in the future to minimize operational impact?

This incident was first detected on 10/07/2024 at approximately 14:40 CET by our internal SOC, following alerts from our SIEM (Elastic Stack) regarding anomalous API activity and possible data exfiltration attempts.\n\nSummary of Incident:\n- Over a 90-minute window, we observed an unusual spike in outbound API requests from the service account 'svc_collab_mgr', which is typically restricted to workflow automation tasks. These requests included large volume exports of project task data, user messaging logs, and attached files\u2014far exceeding normal operational patterns.\n- The source IP addresses (primarily 178.62.85.199 and 37.120.156.48) are not associated with our internal VPN or trusted partners. Geolocation suggests Eastern Europe, which is outside our expected user base.\n- SIEM correlation identified multiple failed login attempts against privileged user accounts ('pm_admin', 'sg_projectlead') immediately prior to the API activity, followed by a successful authentication for 'svc_collab_mgr' from the above IPs.\n- Review of [audit.log] and [access.log] (extracts attached) shows API tokens were issued to 'svc_collab_mgr' without a corresponding interactive login event, raising suspicion of token theft or abuse of compromised credentials.\n- No signs of ransomware or destructive actions have been observed so far. However, some sensitive project documents (marked as restricted under our internal data classification policy) were among the files exported.\n\nImmediate Actions Taken:\n- The affected service account and all related API tokens have been revoked as of 16:05 CET.\n- We have temporarily disabled external integrations (e.g., with Office365 and Slack) pending further investigation.\n- Forensic snapshots of the relevant cloud containers and user sessions have been preserved for CERT-EU review.\n- Data Protection and Legal Affairs have been notified to assess potential GDPR/NIS2 notification requirements.\n\nAssistance Requested:\n- We request CERT-EU\u2019s support in forensic analysis to confirm the vector of compromise (credential theft, session hijack, or API vulnerability) and to determine the extent of any data exfiltration.\n- Recommendations for improving API security, including token management and monitoring, would be appreciated.\n- Please advise if you require additional logs, memory dumps, or direct access to the affected cloud environment.\n\nThis incident may have implications for inter-DG project collaboration and could affect ongoing workstreams if sensitive information was accessed by unauthorised parties.

This disclosure is submitted under the Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) policy and in alignment with NIS2 obligations.\n\nWhile integrating a new market trend analysis module into our existing investment analytics platform, we observed that the backend data processing pipeline (hosted at hxxps://analytics-backend[.]eib[.]int) is inadvertently exposing a misconfigured file upload endpoint. Specifically, the endpoint at /api/v2/upload-analytics accepts arbitrary file types without adequate content validation or authentication checks. Our internal testing demonstrated that it is possible to upload files containing embedded scripts or executable code, which are subsequently processed by the analytics engine with elevated privileges. This could potentially allow a remote attacker to achieve code execution within the analytics container, manipulate market trend data, or pivot laterally within the infrastructure.\n\nWe have attached a technical report (see: EIB_Analytics_UploadVuln.pdf) containing proof-of-concept payloads, affected request samples, and a high-level risk analysis. At this stage, no exploitation beyond controlled testing has occurred, and no sensitive data was accessed or modified. Our assessment suggests that this vulnerability could be leveraged for both data integrity attacks and broader compromise, especially if chained with other misconfigurations or exposed credentials.\n\nGiven the criticality of accurate analytics for investment risk management and regulatory reporting, we recommend prioritising a review of the upload endpoint and implementing strict file type validation, authentication, and sandboxing for all user-supplied data. Please advise on preferred timelines for coordinated remediation and public disclosure, as well as any additional information you require from our technical team.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.

While the initial hypothesis pointed towards standard resource exhaustion due to peak user activity, our subsequent analysis of server and application logs has revealed a pattern consistent with a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) campaign leveraging a previously untracked botnet infrastructure.\n\nKey observations:\n- Traffic spikes originate from a geographically diverse set of IPs, with a notable concentration from Eastern Europe and parts of Asia.\n- The malicious requests mimic legitimate user behavior, employing randomized user agents and dynamic request intervals, which initially evaded standard WAF rate-limiting rules.\n- We have identified several C2 endpoints coordinating the attack, with domains registered in the past month (see attached IOC list in CSV format). Example: hxxp://control-panel[.]dnetcloud[.]xyz\n- The botnet appears to be exploiting unsecured IoT devices (primarily consumer routers and cameras) as reflected in the device fingerprinting logs.\n\nOur current mitigation steps include dynamic IP blocking, increased application-layer filtering, and notification to upstream providers.

I\u2019m writing from the Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport (DG MOVE). We\u2019ve noticed a strange incident that\u2019s caused some confusion in our unit, and I wanted to get your expert eyes on it.\n\nYesterday afternoon, several colleagues (including myself) received an email that claimed to be from the 'EU Mobility Conference Secretariat'. The sender\u2019s address was eu-mobility-conference@eumove-events[.]org, which I don\u2019t recognise as any official address (we usually see addresses ending in @ec.europa.eu for anything related to official events).\n\nThe subject line read: \u201cFinal Notice: Confirm Your Attendance for EU Mobility Conference 2024.\u201d The body of the email invited us to click a link to \u2018secure our seat\u2019 for the upcoming event in Brussels. There was a large blue \u2018Confirm Registration\u2019 button linking to hxxps://register-eumove[.]org/attendee (defanged). The email looked professional at first glance\u2014logos, conference branding, and even a generic GDPR disclaimer at the bottom\u2014but some things were off. For example, the greeting just said \u201cDear Colleague\u201d and didn\u2019t include names, and the English was a bit awkward (\u201cPlease ensure your account is verified to participate the event without delay.\u201d).\n\nWhat set off alarm bells was the urgency: it claimed if we didn\u2019t act by 16:00 CET, our spots would be given away. One colleague clicked the button out of curiosity and landed on a page that mimicked the real EU Login portal, but the URL was wrong. It asked for full email credentials (username, password, even a mobile number for \u2018identity verification\u2019). Thankfully, I don\u2019t think anyone submitted any details\u2014we\u2019ve warned the team not to interact further. I managed to save a screenshot of the email and the fake login page, which I\u2019m attaching here. Apologies for not including the full message headers; I can forward those later if you need them (I\u2019m not very technical, so might need some help extracting them from Outlook).\n\nWe haven\u2019t seen any direct account compromise yet, but I\u2019m concerned this might be part of a bigger spear-phishing attempt, since several staff working on the real conference received the message. Could you please advise if this matches any known campaigns, and let us know if you need more info? Also, should we circulate an internal warning to other DGs?\n\nThanks for your help and sorry if this isn\u2019t the right channel (I figured better safe than sorry!).\n\nBest regards,\n\nDaniela Rossi\nPolicy Officer, DG MOVE\nEuropean Commission\n\ndaniela.rossi@ec.europa.eu", "created_date": "2024-10-14T00:00:00", "email_address": "daniela.rossi@ec.europa.eu", "assigned_queue": "DFIR::phishing"}

Apologies for the somewhat messy formatting, I just pasted in their full message for context. \n\nTheir analysts have flagged what looks like a new campaign tied to the actor codenamed \"Nebula Hawk\" (previously tracked for targeting energy sector assets in the Baltics). Over the last 72 hours, they\u2019ve picked up a spike in DNS queries and outbound HTTPS traffic from several municipal networks in southern Finland, all resolving to a fresh set of domains (defanged list below) and a previously unseen ASN (AS208856, registered in Bulgaria as per RIPE lookup). \n\nHere\u2019s the core indicator set they provided:\n- Domains: nebula-update[.]com, hawkrelay[.]org, fin-trace[.]eu\n- IPs: 185.189.59.77, 185.189.59.88\n- SHA256 hash of dropper sample: 1f5e3e87b8c3f6dca8f8f3c0e13a5e74b6e1d20e1f5a8e9c3e4c6e9e7b9a8c1d\n\nNCSC-FI notes that initial infection appears to leverage malicious macros in invoices sent to municipal procurement departments (maldoc attachment named \"invoice-2024-07-02.xlsm\"). The dropper then establishes persistence via a scheduled task (\"NebulaUpdater\") and beacons to the above C2s using a custom User-Agent string: \"Mozilla/5.0 (NebulaHawk)\". Network telemetry shows C2 callbacks every 4 minutes, with payloads encrypted using RC4 (static key, included in their enrichment file\u2014see attached CSV).\n\nThey\u2019re requesting cross-EU visibility: has any other CERT or agency observed related infrastructure, TTPs, or targeting? They also mention a possible overlap with previous \"SkyFalcon\" activity reported in early June, though the payload and C2s differ. The attached enrichment includes their YARA rule for the dropper and MITRE ATT&CK mapping (T1566.001, T1059.005, T1071.001). \n\nWe\u2019ve run a quick sweep on our side (DG Energy, EC) and so far no hits, but I\u2019d appreciate if CERT-EU could circulate the indicators to relevant partners and check for any correlations in your datasets. Also, any insight on the Bulgarian ASN or the actor\u2019s current targeting focus would be helpful. \n\nFull NCSC-FI report and IOC set attached (TLP:AMBER, please treat accordingly).

On the morning of 2 July 2024, multiple analytics tools (including our primary risk assessment and portfolio simulation platforms) experienced simultaneous malfunctions. The issue was initially suspected to be related to routine software updates or compatibility errors; however, subsequent investigation by our internal SOC has raised concerns of a possible targeted cyber campaign.\n\nNotably, our monitoring systems detected a cluster of outbound connections to previously unknown domains (e.g., hxxps://dataconn-eu[.]org, hxxps://analytics-sync[.]net) during the initial period of disruption.

Our review of event logs (see attached: EIA_analytics_anomalies_20240702.csv) shows repeated failed authentication attempts from internal service accounts shortly before the outages.\n\nGiven the timing and the breadth of affected systems, we suspect this may be part of a broader campaign targeting EU financial analytics infrastructure.

Earlier this week, we were notified by several external candidates that, upon uploading their identification documents and security clearance certificates to the Secure Applicant Management System (SAMS), they received unexpected error messages indicating potential data exposure.\n\nPreliminary review suggests the issue may be related to legacy authentication mechanisms in SAMS, which do not align with current NIS2 compliance requirements. Despite recent efforts to update user access controls and patch system vulnerabilities, the alerts persist and candidates have reported visible traces of sensitive information (partial passport numbers and names) in browser autofill suggestions\u2014raising concern about possible data leakage.\n\nWe have temporarily suspended document uploads and advised candidates to refrain from further submissions until the issue is resolved. In line with GDPR obligations and internal incident response policy, we kindly request CERT-EU\u2019s assistance in investigating the incident, assessing the potential exposure scope, and providing guidance on next steps to secure the recruitment workflow.

We\u2019ve been working with a new training provider, SecureSkills GmbH, who\u2019s supposed to deliver a half-day session for ECB staff and selected colleagues from other EU institutions next month.\n\nHere\u2019s the snag: when we tried to process their onboarding through the ECB\u2019s Supplier Management Portal (SMP), their representative (Ms. Julia Weiss) reported persistent errors during the digital signature step of the EU-wide vendor compliance form. The system either times out or returns a vague \u2018validation error\u2019 message. She\u2019s tried from different browsers and networks, but no luck. Our IT helpdesk checked and said there\u2019s no current SMP outage, but this seems to be affecting at least two external vendors this week, both in the context of HR-led training events.\n\nI\u2019ve attached a screenshot (see: SMP_vendor_error_20240611.png) and the completed compliance form in PDF, as Ms. Weiss sent it directly to us after multiple failed portal attempts.

These connections originated from workstations running the E-RegData Suite (v5.2.1), which is not supposed to initiate any anonymized traffic by design.\n\nInitial review of Suricata logs revealed multiple HTTP POST requests to hxxp://datacore-gateway[.]org, always following a pattern: the POST body contains what looks like RC4-encrypted blobs, 1024 bytes each, with a recurring header (hex: 0x7E4A3C). No legitimate process is known to use this protocol. We checked the hashes of the involved binaries (primary: 3e7f1d5cdb...b6f2, secondary DLL: 9f4c0e2a...c8b1) and got no hits on VirusTotal or our internal MISP instance.\n\nWe also noticed scheduled tasks (Task Scheduler entry: \"SysUpdate-Check-8am\") spawning PowerShell processes with obfuscated command lines, which subsequently reach out to the above Tor nodes. MITRE ATT&CK mapping suggests T1090.003 (Proxy: Multi-hop Proxy) and T1059.001 (Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell). The activity started after a failed update attempt of the E-RegData Suite, possibly indicating a supply chain vector, but we have not confirmed this yet.\n\nNo exfiltration of sensitive market data has been confirmed, but the persistence and sophistication of the C2 channel is concerning, especially given the criticality of the affected department. We have blocked all Tor traffic at the firewall and are conducting a wider sweep for similar activity across other directorates.\n\nRequesting CTI support for:\n- Enrichment of the attached Tor exit node list (CSV, TLP:AMBER)\n- Any intelligence on recent campaigns leveraging Tor-based C2 against EU regulatory bodies\n- Actor profiling if you have seen similar RC4-encrypted C2 patterns or the datacore-gateway[.]org domain\n\nPlease let us know if you require memory dumps or further endpoint artefacts.

I\u2019m not a technical expert, but I wanted to flag this as soon as possible, since it looks like the simulated adversary activities might be triggering some unexpected behavior in our Azure AD logs.\n\nSpecifically, between 03:00 and 05:00 this morning, we received multiple alerts about failed logins from test accounts (those prefixed with \u201crt-sim\u201d) trying to access the \u201ccollab-portal.europa.eu\u201d SharePoint instance. The IPs logged (145.56.29.187 and 145.56.29.199) match the ones your team provided in the engagement scope, so I\u2019m assuming these are part of the planned lateral movement tests. However, we also saw two separate spikes in conditional access policy denials, which locked out a couple of non-test accounts (julia.b, and t.keller) for about 15 minutes each. Both users reported being unable to access their OneDrive folders and Teams channels during that window, which obviously caused some confusion.\n\nI\u2019ve attached the relevant log extracts (see: AzureAD_AuthEvents_20240703.csv) and a screenshot of the user complaints from our internal helpdesk tool. Can you confirm whether these lockouts were an intended part of the simulation, or if we need to adjust our policies to avoid collateral impact on regular staff? Our IT support is fielding a few tickets already and would like to avoid further disruption if possible.\n\nAlso, please advise if there are any specific hours we should expect more aggressive activity so we can coordinate with the business units. The original schedule mentioned testing between 02:00\u201306:00 CET, but some of these alerts came in slightly outside that window.\n\nSorry if this isn\u2019t the most technical summary, but let me know if you need anything else from our side.

Our analysts have been monitoring several invite-only forums on both Tor and I2P, and we've noticed a marked uptick in discussions around a new marketplace, \"MercuryBazar,\" which appears to be facilitating the sale of initial access credentials for various EU public sector networks. The actors involved are referencing access to Citrix and VMware Horizon environments, specifically mentioning \"EU-regional procurement portals\" and \"municipal data exchange nodes\"\u2014though no explicit institution names are listed.\n\nWe were able to obtain a sample listing (see attached screenshot and redacted forum transcript), which advertises RDP access to a \"LuxGov\"-tagged endpoint, along with a zipped CSV containing a handful of credential pairs (not included here for legal reasons, but we can coordinate secure transfer if required). Sellers are accepting Monero only, and their OPSEC is above average\u2014PGP is mandatory for all communications, and the forum moderators actively scrub any direct links or file hashes.\n\nOur initial review found that the TTPs described (use of stealer logs, brute-forced VPN accounts, and lateral movement via SMB shares) overlap with those seen in the \"IronClad\" access broker group, though attribution remains low-confidence at this stage. No confirmed breaches reported yet, but we recommend raising awareness with your constituency, especially for organizations running externally exposed Citrix or Horizon instances.\n\nLet us know if you need further details or would like to coordinate on deeper infiltration of this marketplace.

During a scheduled user onboarding session last week, we observed that certain access controls within the dashboard\u2019s layout configuration can be bypassed, allowing standard users to modify widgets and visibility settings intended solely for administrative roles.\n\nThe issue arises when a user manipulates specific parameters in the dashboard\u2019s layout API requests (notably, the 'role' and 'widget_id' fields). This enables them to reorder, hide, or expose tools that should be restricted, potentially resulting in accidental data exposure or workflow disruptions.

On 27 June 2024, our team at the European University Data Science Centre observed anomalous query patterns targeting our central MySQL database cluster (host: db-tensor.intra.university.eu). These queries originated from an internal service account (svc_tensorflow) used by a TensorFlow-based analytics pipeline, which is not typically authorised to access sensitive datasets containing personal and research grant information.\n\nThe anomaly was initially detected via our SIEM (Elastic Stack), which flagged an unusually high volume of SELECT and DUMP commands issued by svc_tensorflow between 03:20 and 04:05 CET. Further investigation revealed the account had accessed several tables outside its standard scope, including those with GDPR-protected records. Our review of [mysql_general.log] (see attached extract) shows the following example query:\n\n2024-06-27 03:36:12 | svc_tensorflow | SELECT * FROM eu_grant_applicants WHERE nationality = 'DE';\n\nAdditionally, outbound network monitoring registered encrypted data transfers from host analytics-tf01.university.eu to an external IP (194.187.249.18), which is not whitelisted for institutional use. At this time, it is unclear whether this activity is the result of a misconfiguration or a compromised service account.\n\nImmediate actions taken:\n- Disabled svc_tensorflow credentials and halted all TensorFlow-MySQL integrations pending further review\n- Isolated analytics-tf01.university.eu from the campus network\n- Preserved relevant database and network logs for forensic analysis\n\nWe request CERT-EU's assistance in determining the nature and scope of this potential breach, and in advising on containment and notification obligations under GDPR and NIS2. Please advise if you require additional artifacts or system images for analysis.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.

Over the past 48 hours, our honeypots have flagged a spike in inbound traffic on TCP/45777 and UDP/29900 from a diverse set of global IPs, mostly in the Asia-Pacific region. The pattern doesn\u2019t match previous Mirai or Mozi botnet activity we\u2019ve tracked in the past quarter.\n\nOur automated analysis pipeline (Elastic SIEM + Zeek) extracted several unique payloads. One sample (SHA256: 2b1c9fdb...a2e34) appears to be a custom ELF binary with embedded domain generation algorithm (DGA) logic, generating pseudo-random subdomains under \"connect-hub[.]io\" and \"fastmesh[.]cc\". Reverse engineering shows the binary attempts to beacon every 37 minutes and includes an unusual XOR-based config encryption. No clear overlap with known IoCs in our MISP instance as of this morning.\n\nNotably, two Lithuanian public sector endpoints (Ministry of Social Security and Labour, and a Vilnius university research cluster) initiated outbound connections to the above domains. We\u2019re still determining initial infection vectors, but the endpoints had RDP and SMB open to the public internet, which could be related.\n\nPlease see attached CSV (TLP:AMBER) with observed C2 IPs (defanged), DGA subdomain patterns, and relevant network artifacts. We\u2019re hoping CERT-EU can:\n- Cross-reference these indicators with any recent botnet infrastructure takedown efforts or emerging C2 clusters across EU institutions\n- Share any TTP overlaps with active campaigns or actor profiles (MITRE ATT&CK T1071.001 \u2013 Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols, T1095 \u2013 Non-Application Layer Protocol)\n- Advise on possible attribution or mitigation steps for affected public sector assets\n\nSorry for the rushed note, it\u2019s been a long night shift.

Yesterday (12 July 2024), around 18:35 CEST, our Zabbix monitoring flagged a significant outbound traffic spike from node rc-07a.jrc.it (part of the Joint Research Centre\u2019s bioinformatics group), which is unexpected at that hour and volume. The NOC alerted us to over 12GB of data sent to an external address (193.34.21.114), which isn't whitelisted and has no prior connection to our environment.\n\nInitial investigation by our sysadmin found these entries in the pfSense firewall logs:\n\n[2024-07-12 18:35:08] ALLOW OUT: rc-07a.jrc.it \u2192 193.34.21.114:443 (TLS)\n[2024-07-12 18:36:10] ALLOW OUT: rc-07a.jrc.it \u2192 193.34.21.114:443 (TLS)\n[2024-07-12 18:39:45] ALLOW OUT: rc-07a.jrc.it \u2192 193.34.21.114:443 (TLS)\n\nWe double-checked the cluster jobs running at that time. No user-initiated tasks match the transfer size, and SLURM job logs show only routine data crunching, not exports. Further, Splunk records show a suspicious process tree: '/usr/bin/python3' launched by 'slurm' user, executing a script ('bio_extract_20240712.py') not present in our git repo or job submissions. The script was wiped from /tmp within minutes after the transfer.\n\nNo antivirus or EDR (we use SentinelOne) flagged the file or process, but the timing and lack of known workflow suggest possible compromise or insider misuse. We have preserved a memory dump and are locking down SSH access to the affected node. For context, rc-07a handles large, non-classified datasets, but the destination IP appears linked to a VPS provider in Moldova per our threat intel feeds.\n\nWe\u2019re escalating as a potential data exfiltration incident.

As part of our ongoing review of third-party integrations and their associated security posture, we examined the OAuth2-based authentication workflow currently implemented for Xero connections.\n\nDuring this process, we identified that the integration endpoint (hxxps://api.saas-project.eu/integrations/xero/callback) does not sufficiently validate the 'redirect_uri' parameter. This could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the OAuth flow and capture authentication tokens by supplying a crafted redirect URI, thereby gaining unauthorised access to sensitive financial data within connected Xero accounts. Our preliminary tests indicate that the endpoint does not enforce a strict allowlist of permitted redirect URIs, which is contrary to best practices outlined in the ENISA guidelines and may introduce a risk of account compromise.\n\nWe have attached a technical report detailing our test cases, HTTP request samples, and suggested mitigation strategies.

Ms. Ingrid Nowak from the Polish Ministry of Digital Affairs attended the Cybersecurity Awareness for Public Sector Employees session we hosted on 14\u201315 May 2024 in Brussels. She has reached out asking for an official certificate of attendance, which she needs to submit to her HR department for their internal training records.\n\nUnfortunately, I can\u2019t find the template we used for last year\u2019s certificates, and I\u2019m not sure if there have been any updates to the formatting or required signatures since then. I recall there was a new policy about including the event code and the EU emblem on all official training documents, but I haven\u2019t seen a finalized version yet. Also, Ms. Nowak mentioned she would appreciate a digital copy with a secure signature, if possible, as her department prefers digital documentation for compliance reasons.\n\nCould someone please confirm the current process for issuing these certificates? If there\u2019s a standard template or SharePoint folder where the latest version is stored, please let me know. Alternatively, if you need me to draft the certificate based on last year\u2019s format, I\u2019m happy to do so\u2014just need to double-check if the signatory should still be the Head of HR or if that\u2019s changed. \n\nI\u2019ve attached Ms. Nowak\u2019s original email below for reference. Please advise how best to proceed, and let me know if you need any additional details from the participant or the event organisers.\n\nThanks a lot for your help!\n\nBest regards,\n\nLucas Bernard\nTraining Coordination Assistant\nCERT-EU\n\n--- Forwarded message from ingrid.nowak@mc.gov.pl ---\nDear CERT-EU team,\nThank you for the excellent training in Brussels last month. Could you please provide an official certificate of attendance for my records? My HR department requires this for compliance. A digital version would be ideal. Many thanks!\nBest regards,\nIngrid Nowak", "created_date": "2024-01-02T00:00:00", "email_address": "lucas.bernard@cert.europa.eu", "assigned_queue": "SMS"}
{"ticket_id": "TKT-25BB23E9", "title": "Service Disruption During External Pentest \u2013 Secure Communications Gateway", "content": "Dear CERT-EU Pentesting Team,\n\nWe are experiencing a sudden disruption in the functionality of our secure communications gateway, which coincided with the active phase of an external penetration test currently underway (ref: EXT-PT-2024-044). The system began dropping connections unexpectedly overnight. Preliminary checks by our technical team suggest a possible misconfiguration in our PostgreSQL cluster, though this remains unconfirmed. Restarting the affected VM and reviewing syslogs has not restored service.\n\nCould you confirm whether any of your test vectors (e.g., authentication bypass or SQL injection probes) targeted the gateway during this period? If so, can you share any relevant attack paths, timestamps, or initial findings to help us distinguish legitimate test activity from potential real-world threats? Timely clarification would assist us in maintaining operational continuity and fulfilling our NIS2 incident response requirements.\n\nPlease advise if you need additional access to our monitoring dashboards or further logs. Thank you for your cooperation and prompt feedback.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJohan Bergstr\u00f6m\nIT Operations Specialist\nEuropean Parliament DG ITEC", "created_date": "2025-01-13", "email_address": "johan.bergstrom@europarl.europa.eu", "assigned_queue": "OFFSEC::Pentesting", "original_queue": "Service Outages and Maintenance"}
