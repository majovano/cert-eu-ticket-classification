Over the past 48 hours, our team observed a sharp and unexplained drop in user interactions and engagement metrics on the official 'EU Voices' portal (euvoices.consilium.europa.eu), which serves as a primary channel for citizen feedback on EU initiatives.\n\nInitial checks by our communications staff did not reveal any changes to campaign content or targeting settings that would account for the sudden decline. However, following a tip from our web analytics vendor, our IT staff reviewed the backend logs and noticed several anomalous HTTP POST requests originating from multiple external IPs (e.g., 212.83.140.55, 91.198.174.192). These requests targeted the campaign feedback submission endpoint and included suspiciously crafted payloads with embedded SQL syntax (e.g., ' OR 1=1 --) and user agents mimicking outdated browsers.\n\nOur web application firewall (WAF) flagged several of these requests as potential SQL injection attempts between 19 and 21 June 2024.

While auditing the mobile app 'EuroSecure Connect' (Android v3.7.12, package: eu.euconnect.mobile) for my thesis, I stumbled across a potential insecure direct object reference (IDOR) issue affecting user profile exports. Basically, by intercepting traffic with Burp Suite, I noticed the endpoint /api/v2/profile/export accepts arbitrary user IDs without checking session tokens properly. As a result, I could access profile data (email, org affiliation, photo) of other users, just by swapping the id parameter\u2014see attached screenshots.\n\nThis was tested using test accounts only, not real user data. I'm not sure if this endpoint is widely used, but the risk seems non-trivial if exploited. Please advise if you want a detailed PoC or further info. I'm happy to coordinate CVD according to your process and can keep details confidential for up to 90 days if needed.\n\nRegards,\n\nSini V\u00e4is\u00e4nen\nPostgraduate Student, University of Helsinki", "created_date": "2025-01-23T00:00:00", "email_address": "sini.vaisanen@cs.helsinki.fi", "assigned_queue": "OFFSEC::CVD"}
{"ticket_id": "TKT-8497F45A", "title": "Suspected APT28 Intrusion Targeting EU Medical Research Data \u2013 IOC Sharing & Exploitation of CVE-2024-32519", "content": "Dear CERT-EU CTI Team,\n\nI am writing to inform you of a potential nation-state-linked intrusion targeting sensitive medical research data within our institution. During routine security monitoring this morning (20 June 2024), our SOC detected unauthorised access attempts against a segment of our eHealth research network, specifically involving data repositories that contain anonymised patient records and genomic datasets. \n\nInitial analysis of the intrusion logs indicates the use of advanced credential harvesting techniques and exploitation of a recently disclosed vulnerability (CVE-2024-32519) in our secure file transfer gateway. The attack vector appears to be consistent with TTPs previously attributed to the APT28 cluster, including the use of bespoke PowerShell payloads and C2 traffic obfuscated via DNS tunneling (MITRE ATT&CK T1071.004, T1059.001). \n\nWe have contained the affected systems and are conducting a forensic review. At this stage, we have not confirmed any data exfiltration, but there are signs of lateral movement attempts toward adjacent research clusters. Out of caution, we have isolated these segments and initiated password resets for all privileged accounts.\n\nEnclosed as attachments (TLP:AMBER) are:\n- A STIX 2.1 bundle containing IOCs (source IPs, SHA256 hashes of payloads, C2 domains)\n- Extracted logs showing suspicious authentication events and file access patterns\n- A short technical report summarising the timeline and detection methods\n\nGiven the strategic value of the targeted data and the apparent sophistication of the intrusion, we would appreciate your urgent support with:\n1. Cross-referencing the enclosed indicators with known APT28 infrastructure or similar campaigns observed in the EU health sector\n2. Any intelligence on recent exploitation of CVE-2024-32519 or similar attack chains in European research environments\n3. Guidance on post-incident monitoring and notification procedures in line with NIS2 and GDPR obligations\n\nPlease let us know if further artefacts (memory dumps, full packet captures) are required for deeper analysis. We are committed to full cooperation and are available for a follow-up call should you need more context or direct access to our incident response team.\n\nThank you for your swift attention to this matter. We look forward to your expert recommendations and threat intelligence support.\n\nBest regards,\n\nDr. Annika Schulz\nHead of Information Security\nEuropean Institute for Biomedical Research", "created_date": "2024-07-12", "email_address": "annika.schulz@eibr.europa.eu", "assigned_queue": "CTI", "original_queue": "Product Support"}
{"ticket_id": "TKT-4241E277", "title": "Phishing Alert: ECB Digital Identity Verification Scam Targeting EU Staff", "content": "Dear CERT-EU DFIR Team,\n\nI would like to bring to your attention a suspicious email that was circulated to several members of our communications unit this afternoon. The message appears to impersonate the European Central Bank and is titled \"Important: Digital Identity Verification Required for EU Staff\". The sender address is ec-digitalid@eucb-identity[.]eu, which is clearly not an official ECB or EU domain, though it superficially resembles one.\n\nThe body of the email urges recipients to \"enhance your digital profile security\" by following a link to verify their EU login credentials. The link, which I have defanged here, is hxxps://ecb-digitalid[.]eu-secure[.]org/verify. The message claims this verification is mandatory due to \"new EU-wide digital identity compliance regulations\" and threatens \"limited access to digital services\" if not completed within 48 hours. Several staff were concerned, as the language references recent EU digital security initiatives and uses ECB branding (logo was embedded in the email).\n\nUpon initial inspection, I noticed some subtle grammar issues and the lack of standard ECB communication footers. No one in our team has clicked the link or provided any credentials so far, but there is confusion among less technical colleagues given the plausible context and formal tone. I have attached a screenshot of the email (with headers visible) for your review. Please let me know if you require the original .eml file or additional logs for further analysis.\n\nWe are aware of our obligations under NIS2 and GDPR, and have already advised our staff to disregard the message and not interact with any links. However, I wanted to escalate this promptly in case similar phishing attempts are targeting other EU institutions.\n\nCould you please confirm if this is part of a known phishing campaign, and advise on any additional containment or awareness actions we should take? Any feedback on technical indicators to watch for would be appreciated.\n\nThank you for your support.\n\nBest regards,\n\nSofia Demetriou\nCommunications Officer\nDirectorate-General for Communication\nEuropean Commission", "created_date": "2024-06-22", "email_address": "sofia.demetriou@ec.europa.eu", "assigned_queue": "DFIR::phishing", "original_queue": "IT Support"}
{"ticket_id": "TKT-4FF574A9", "title": "Privilege Escalation in Azure Subscription: Unauthorised Admin Role Assignments Detected in ECDC Cloud Environment", "content": "Subject: [FWD: Unusual Azure Portal Activity - Possible Admin Account Misuse?]\n\nHi CERT-EU DFIR,\n\nForwarding this as requested by our cloud ops lead\u2014apologies for the late notice, things have been a bit hectic this afternoon.\n\nSummary:\nAround 13:30 CET today (17 June 2024), our Azure Security Center flagged a sequence of privilege escalations within the ECDC\u2019s (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) main Azure subscription (ecdc-core-prod). The alert was triggered after a routine policy compliance scan detected new global admin assignments to two service accounts (svc_graphapi1, svc_deploybot2) that do NOT normally require such rights. These changes originated from a user session attributed to \"m.petrosyan@ecdc.europa.eu\"\u2014a legitimate admin, but the timing and context look off.\n\nNotable findings:\n- The admin role assignments occurred from an IP address in Vilnius (85.206.123.45), which is not in the usual geo-fence for our cloud admins (typically Stockholm or Brussels).\n- Azure AD sign-in logs show a failed MFA attempt for m.petrosyan about 30 seconds before the successful login.\n- Immediately after, multiple Azure Resource Manager (ARM) deployments were kicked off, including a template referencing a previously unseen storage account (ecdc-logs-temp).\n- Our EDR (Defender for Cloud) flagged an unusual PowerShell execution on the admin\u2019s workstation, launching Connect-AzAccount with the \u2013UseDeviceAuthentication flag\u2014something we rarely see internally.\n\nActions so far:\n- Revoked all active sessions for m.petrosyan and the affected service accounts.\n- Rolled back the suspicious role assignments and temporarily disabled programmatic access to the subscription.\n- Notified our DPO as a precaution\u2014no confirmed data leakage, but we\u2019re still pulling activity logs for exfil signs.\n- Collected full [AzureADSignIns.csv], relevant [activitylog.json], and Defender for Cloud alerts (see attached: ecdc_azure_incident_20240617.zip).\n\nQuestions/Assistance Needed:\n- Can you assist in reviewing whether this was a targeted phishing attempt or token theft? We\u2019re not sure if the PowerShell activity was legitimate troubleshooting or an attacker\u2019s persistence move.\n- Should we coordinate with Microsoft IR or proceed with our own deeper forensic imaging?\n- Please advise on any additional indicators to search for (esp. lateral movement into our on-prem AD via AAD Connect).\n\nLet me know if you need more log samples or a live call. Thanks for the support\u2014sorry if the formatting is a bit messy, just trying to get this escalated ASAP.\n\nBest regards,\n\n--\nAnete Ozoli\u0146a\nCloud Platform Administrator\nECDC IT Operations\nanete.ozolina@ecdc.europa.eu", "created_date": "2025-05-03T00:00:00", "email_address": "anete.ozolina@ecdc.europa.eu", "assigned_queue": "DFIR::incidents"}
