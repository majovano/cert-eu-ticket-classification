Specifically, we observed that the analytics tool\u2019s OAuth implementation does not properly validate redirect URIs, which could allow for an open redirect or even token interception if exploited. \n\nThe issue was initially detected on 3 July 2024, while testing custom dashboards for investment optimization. Our security logs indicate that the analytics tool accepts arbitrary redirect_uri parameters during the OAuth flow, enabling an attacker to potentially capture access tokens by redirecting users to a malicious endpoint. No exploitation has been observed so far, but the risk is considerable given the sensitivity of investment data processed by the CRM.\n\nWe have attached a technical report (oauth_redirect_validation_issue.pdf) detailing our findings, including step-by-step reproduction instructions and sample HTTP requests. In line with NIS2 and GDPR compliance, we have temporarily restricted integrations with the affected analytics platform pending further investigation.\n\nWe request CERT-EU\u2019s guidance on coordinated disclosure to the vendor and any recommendations for immediate risk mitigation.

One user (Dr. Conti) reported that her session terminated unexpectedly and she was logged out, even though she hadn\u2019t touched anything.\n\nOur local IT support checked the system and found a PowerShell script executing from C:\\Users\\Public\\lib\\update_cache.ps1, which is not something we recognize or have deployed. The process tree (from Sysmon) shows the script being launched by a parent process called msedge.exe, which I guess is the Edge browser? We don\u2019t normally allow Edge to run scripts, so that\u2019s odd.\n\nIn the event logs, there are multiple entries for outbound connections to IP 217.160.48.119 over TCP/8088, initiated by PowerShell. The script itself tries to download a file named update.exe from hxxp://cdn-eu1[.]fileshare[.]eu/downloads/ and then creates a scheduled task called \u201cCacheUpdater\u201d.\n\nWe immediately disconnected the workstation from the lab network and ran a basic AV scan (Windows Defender), which detected \u2018Trojan:Win32/Emotet.B\u2019 and quarantined update.exe, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the end of it. No other workstations in the immediate vicinity are showing alerts yet, but I\u2019m worried about lateral movement or data loss. The shared folder D:\\Projects\\EU-BioData\\ is accessible from this host and contains project files for the EU-wide research collaboration, some of which are confidential.\n\nWe\u2019ve collected relevant logs (Sysmon, Windows Event Viewer, Defender logs), and I\u2019m attaching a sample here (\u2018bio-analyt05_logs_20240715.zip\u2019). Our IT said they saw attempts to create new local user accounts (user: temp_svc) right before we unplugged the device.\n\nWe\u2019re not sure how the script got there \u2013 Dr. Conti mentioned she downloaded a PDF from an external conference site earlier in the day, but nothing looked suspicious. No suspicious emails reported either.\n\nPlease advise on next steps: should we reimage the workstation? Do we need to scan other lab PCs, or notify project partners? We\u2019re a bit out of our depth on this, so any help is appreciated.

Over the past week, our research group at KU Leuven has been tracking a new ransomware affiliate recruitment thread on a Russian-language forum (see attached screenshots, TLP:GREEN). The actor, using the alias \u201ccyberCossack\u201d, is advertising access to compromised EU municipal networks, specifically mentioning Belgian and Dutch city councils.

Despite several remediation attempts\u2014including full software reinstalls, profile resets, and validation of OS integrity\u2014the issue remains unresolved and appears to be spreading incrementally to additional endpoints.\n\nInitial telemetry analysis suggests that the affected applications are being terminated abruptly, with event logs showing anomalous DLL injections and unexpected child process spawns shortly before each halt. Notably, several crash reports reference the loading of unsigned modules from the user\u2019s temp directory, and in at least three cases, we identified outbound traffic to defanged domains such as hxxps://aud-update[.]syncserve[.]net and hxxps://skp-connect[.]relaymail[.]org.

These nodes appear to be running custom Scikit-learn models for rapid identification of arbitrage opportunities and market-moving events, which are then used to inform coordinated trading activity and, in some cases, disinformation operations via automated botnets.\n\nOur reverse engineering of several captured binaries (see attached ZIP with SHA256 hashes and YARA signatures) indicates that at least two financially motivated groups\u2014one with moderate confidence attributed to \"Silent Ledger\"\u2014are orchestrating these campaigns. MITRE ATT&CK techniques observed include T1609 (Container Administration Command), T1589.002 (Gather Victim Identity Information: Financial), and T1566.002 (Spearphishing via Service).\n\nWe have also identified several domains and IPs linked to this activity (see attached CSV), including hxxps://ml-trade-bot[.]net and hxxps://eu-arbitrage[.]cloud. These indicators have not yet been flagged in major threat feeds, so we are sharing them proactively in line with NIS2 threat sharing requirements. Please note that our findings suggest a growing trend of adversaries using legitimate data science tools for illicit financial gain and market manipulation within the EU regulatory environment.\n\nWe would appreciate any additional intelligence on:\n- Overlap with known campaigns targeting EU financial sector entities\n- Further infrastructure or TTPs linked to \"Silent Ledger\" or similar groups\n- Recommendations for detection and mitigation, especially regarding abuse of open-source ML frameworks\n\nIf you have observed similar patterns or can enrich our indicators, your input would be highly valuable. Please let us know if you require full packet captures, additional malware samples, or a MISP export for further analysis.

The engagement is set to begin on 2 July and run through 5 July, with all test traffic originating from the IP range 198.51.100.32/28 as previously agreed.\n\nAs part of the pre-engagement planning phase, we have encountered an issue that requires your input before proceeding. Specifically, our team is unable to validate the readiness of our new Secure Remote Access Gateway (SRAG) for inclusion in the scope of the test. The SRAG (hosted at hxxps://remote.eesc.europa.eu) was recently deployed to replace our legacy VPN solution, and while initial configuration reviews suggest compliance with baseline security standards, we have not yet completed a full audit of the access control policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA) integration.\n\nGiven the gateway\u2019s critical role in facilitating remote access for staff and external partners, we are concerned about the risk of inadvertent service disruption or exposure of sensitive authentication flows during the active penetration test. We would appreciate your guidance on the following points:\n\n1. Can the SRAG be safely included in the initial test scope, or would you recommend a phased approach (e.g., initial reconnaissance only, with exploitation attempts deferred until post-MFA audit)?\n2. Are there specific artefacts or configuration exports we should provide to facilitate risk-aware testing (e.g., sanitized policy configs, sample authentication logs)?\n3. Would it be possible to schedule a short pre-test call to clarify the engagement boundaries and agree on real-time communication channels for incident response?\n\nWe have attached a summary of the current SRAG configuration (see: SRAG_Config_Summary_20240625.pdf) for your reference. Please let us know if additional documentation or access is required. Our aim is to ensure that the penetration test delivers maximum value while minimizing the risk of operational impact, especially in light of ongoing hybrid work arrangements.\n\nThank you in advance for your support and expertise.

The process was launched by the SYSTEM account and subsequently initiated multiple outbound connections to the external IP address 91.207.58.12, which is not recognized as part of our trusted network perimeter.\n- Concurrently, Sysmon logs captured several PowerShell script executions leveraging encoded command parameters. One of the scripts attempted to enumerate user sessions and extract data from a mapped network share containing pseudonymised patient datasets (directory: \\\\research-nas\\patient_data2024).\n- We also observed a spike in outbound traffic volume between 03:42 and 03:46 CET, with a significant portion directed to hxxps://meddata-transfer[.]pro. The destination domain is not on our allowlist and is flagged by Threat Intelligence feeds as potentially malicious.\n\nPreliminary Analysis:\n- The server in question was running outdated Windows Server 2016 patches, and our vulnerability scanner had previously flagged it for missing KB5024286 (May 2024 cumulative update). Initial review suggests possible exploitation of CVE-2024-21338 (Win32k privilege escalation).\n- Our internal SIEM (Elastic Stack) indicates that SYSTEM privileges were used to access and attempt to compress several large CSV files from the patient data share, but we have not yet confirmed full data exfiltration.\n- Authentication logs show failed login attempts from the same external IP prior to the binary execution, targeting the 'svc_medadmin' service account.\n\nActions Taken So Far:\n- Isolated medrec-02 from the internal network and disabled the affected service account.\n- Collected volatile memory and disk images for forensic preservation (see attachments: 'medrec02_memdump.bin', 'sysmon_events_20240620.log').\n- Informed the Data Protection Officer for preliminary GDPR assessment, given the sensitivity of the datasets involved.\n\nAssistance Requested:\n- Urgent review of attached forensic artefacts to confirm method of compromise and assess potential data exfiltration scope.\n- Guidance on notification requirements under NIS2 and any immediate remediation steps you recommend.\n- Coordination with relevant law enforcement if external actors are confirmed.\n\nPlease confirm receipt of this report and indicate if additional information is required.

The issue was first noticed when several scheduled posts failed to publish, and diagnostic logs indicated repeated authentication errors and unexpected API calls to unfamiliar endpoints (see attached network trace extract).\n\nTechnical Details:\nUpon investigation, we discovered that the affected integration modules (specifically, the 'EuroSocial' connector v3.2.7) were making outbound connections to hxxps://api-social-sync[.]org and hxxps://cdn-metrics[.]net, neither of which are part of our approved service list. These endpoints have been associated in recent CTI reports (ref: MISP event #2741, TLP:AMBER) with a campaign attributed to the \"Blue Antelope\" threat group, known for targeting EU institutional branding assets.\n\nInitial remediation steps included:\n- Restarting the impacted campaign management servers\n- Rolling back to previous plugin versions\n- Blocking outbound traffic to the identified suspicious domains at the firewall level\n\nDespite these actions, we continue to observe attempted connections and sporadic service interruptions, raising concerns about persistence mechanisms or additional compromised components. The incident currently impacts several ongoing EU-wide awareness initiatives, with potential reputational risk if campaign messaging is further disrupted or manipulated.\n\nAssistance Requested:\nWe are seeking:\n- Any intelligence you may have regarding recent Blue Antelope activity or associated infrastructure\n- Enrichment of the attached IOC list (IPs, domains, plugin hashes)\n- Guidance on further containment and monitoring steps, especially in line with NIS2 requirements for digital service providers\n\nFor your reference, attached is a zipped archive containing relevant server logs, a CSV of observed suspicious connections, and the affected plugin binaries for malware analysis. All information is shared under TLP:AMBER, and we are prepared to provide additional artefacts if required.\n\nPlease advise on any sector-specific advisories or trends relating to supply chain compromise via digital marketing integrations.

We\u2019ve run into something odd this afternoon (09/07/2024, around 14:20 CET) on one of our analyst workstations (hostname: EUROPOL-WS12). One of our junior staff, Petra Novak, reported her laptop being unusually slow and the fan running at max, even though she was only using Outlook and our case management system.\n\nWhen I remoted in, I saw a suspicious process in Task Manager (powershell.exe running as SYSTEM), which kept popping back up even after being killed.

The outbound connection is blocked by our firewall now, but not before several attempts were logged. Our EDR (CrowdStrike) flagged this as a possible fileless malware infection, but hasn\u2019t quarantined anything yet. No obvious signs of lateral movement, but a couple of other hosts (EUROPOL-WS09 and WS14) show similar command lines, so this might be spreading.\n\nImmediate steps we\u2019ve taken:\n- Isolated the affected workstations from the network\n- Disabled the user accounts on those machines as a precaution\n- Grabbed full memory dumps and exported the relevant [Sysmon] logs (attached)\n\nWe haven\u2019t found any evidence of data exfiltration so far, but we\u2019re not sure what the payload does yet.

Post-deployment of the most recent software update (v5.12.4, deployed 2024-05-29), we have observed repeated instability and degraded performance, manifesting as slow load times and intermittent crashes for authenticated users.\n\nUpon further inspection, our technical team identified that the root cause may be related to a deserialization vulnerability in the application\u2019s session management logic. Specifically, the backend appears to be improperly handling serialized user session tokens, which are exchanged between the client and server during project board operations. During testing, we were able to manipulate serialized data in the session cookie, resulting in application crashes and, in one controlled scenario, limited arbitrary code execution in the application context (see attached PoC and crash logs).\n\nThe affected endpoint is:\n\n- hxxps://pmtools-internal[.]ec.europa.eu/api/session/restore\n\nThe vulnerability seems to be exacerbated by the recent update, which introduced a new session persistence module without adequate input validation or integrity checks. We have attached technical details, sample requests, and anonymised logs for your review. No exploitation has been observed in production, and no user data appears to have been exfiltrated at this stage. However, we consider this a high-severity issue due to the potential for privilege escalation or lateral movement if exploited by a threat actor with network access.\n\nIn line with CERT-EU\u2019s Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure policy and our obligations under NIS2, we request guidance on public disclosure timelines and would appreciate support with vendor coordination if required.

This coincided with the deployment of a recent vendor firmware update. Since then, the cleaning automation service has experienced repeated outages, resulting in service delays and a backlog of unscheduled maintenance tasks. \n\nPreliminary analysis of the API logs (attached in CSV format) revealed multiple access attempts originating from non-whitelisted internal IPs (192.168.24.112, 192.168.24.131) and an unexpected outbound connection attempt to hxxps://autoclean-status[.]eu-robotics[.]org. These IPs are not assigned to the robotics subnet, and the destination domain is unrecognised by our supplier. Our endpoint telemetry further suggests potential exploitation of the API update mechanism, possibly leveraging a known vulnerability (CVE-2024-18842, API authentication bypass, CVSS 8.2). \n\nActions taken so far:\n- Immediate restart of the affected server and temporary network segmentation of the robotics control VLAN\n- Review of recent API and system logs (sample attached)\n- Contacted the vendor for firmware integrity validation (awaiting response)\n\nRequest:\nGiven the risk of supply chain compromise and the unusual outbound traffic, we would appreciate your support with the following:\n1.

Initial troubleshooting steps\u2014including system reboots and clearing local caches\u2014have not resolved the underlying problem.\n\nGiven the persistent nature of these outages and the platform\u2019s critical role in supporting ongoing EU budgetary oversight, we suspect that the root cause may be linked to underlying security vulnerabilities or resource exhaustion resulting from unintentional exposure to external threat vectors. Our internal logs indicate sporadic spikes in network traffic and a series of failed authentication attempts from unfamiliar IP ranges, which could suggest the presence of a denial-of-service (DoS) or brute-force attack vector targeting the analytics infrastructure.\n\nTo ensure compliance with NIS2 and our internal risk management framework, we are requesting an external penetration test focused on:\n- Assessing the resilience of the platform against DoS and brute-force attacks\n- Identifying any misconfigured access controls or exposed administrative interfaces\n- Reviewing server resource allocation and authentication mechanisms for potential exploitation\n\nWe have attached the most recent incident logs (see: Analytics_Outage_Logs_June2024.zip) and a brief network topology overview for your reference.

As an analyst within the Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs (DG ECFIN), I have noticed consistent anomalies in the investment projection outputs over the last several weeks.\n\nUpon further examination, it appears that the application\u2019s results are being influenced by an insecure integration with a third-party open source library used for data processing (libfinanalyze v2.1.7). Specifically, I observed that untrusted input data from external market feeds is processed without adequate validation, creating a potential for injection-based manipulation of financial forecasts. Initial static code analysis revealed that certain API endpoints (notably /api/forecast/import) pass feed parameters directly into the data processing routines without sanitisation, making them susceptible to crafted payloads.\n\nThis flaw could allow an attacker with access to the market data feeds to introduce malicious inputs, potentially resulting in manipulated forecasting outputs, data integrity issues, or even code execution depending on the environment. To illustrate the risk, I have prepared a minimal proof-of-concept payload (see attached .txt and log extracts) that, when submitted through the affected endpoint, causes erroneous investment forecasts to be generated.\n\nGiven the criticality of accurate financial projections for EU policy decisions and the possible implications for compliance with NIS2 and internal risk management standards, I believe this warrants immediate review.

The initial detection was flagged at 16:47 CET today (22/07/2024) by a correlation rule matching unusual geographic login attempts and subsequent privilege escalation events.\n\nSummary of findings so far:\n- Multiple successful VPN authentications to vpn-gateway2.ep.intra from two IPs outside our usual geofencing policy: 203.0.113.55 (Singapore) and 41.77.215.198 (Nigeria), both flagged by our threat intelligence feeds (MISP, Anomali).\n- Affected user: janine.dupont (Member Services), whose account was last used from Brussels on 19/07/2024. MFA logs show no token prompt for the suspicious logins, suggesting possible session token theft or SAML replay.\n- Immediately after the remote logins, audit trails show elevation of privileges to the \"EP-RemoteAdmins\" group, which should require explicit approval.

A review of CrowdStrike Falcon EDR on janine.dupont\u2019s assigned workstation (host: ws-ep-3491) shows no recent malware or suspicious process execution, but we are still collecting memory dumps for further analysis.\n\nOpen questions:\n- Is there any evidence of lateral movement from vpn-gateway2.ep.intra to other internal subnets?

Our internal telemetry (see attached: anssi-telemetry-20240702.csv) has flagged a cluster of lookalike domains and a new set of IPs (see below) serving malicious login pages mimicking the legitimate impots.gouv.fr interface.\n\nPreliminary analysis points to infrastructure overlap with the actor known as \"DarkRed\" (see also MISP event #43127, TLP:AMBER, shared last month). The phishing kit deployed here appears to leverage custom obfuscation, including Unicode homoglyph substitution in domain names, and dynamic redirectors hosted on VPS nodes in Romania and the Czech Republic.\n\nKey indicators:\n- Malicious domains (not previously seen in our datasets):\n  * impots-gouv-fr[.]online\n  * impotsg0uv[.]fr\n- Hosting IPs:\n  * 185.213.22.57\n  * 194.62.84.129\n- SHA256 of kit archive: 2e4f8b79e4e13f8e71a1cbeea9d8c2f9b6a6a8c3c12c5c3c8b4c4c0e1a8d7c6f\n\nThe kit\u2019s panel shows credential logs being exfiltrated to hxxps://panel-darkred[.]cc/admin via POST requests, using a Telegram bot API for operator notifications (Telegram channel: @darkred_ops).\n\nWe\u2019ve mapped observed TTPs to MITRE ATT&CK T1566.001 (Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment) and T1583.001 (Acquire Infrastructure: Domains). Attribution confidence is moderate, based on panel artefacts and domain registration patterns.\n\nRequest: Can CERT-EU cross-reference these indicators with recent phishing waves in other EU institutions? We suspect this is part of a coordinated campaign, given the volume and timing. Please advise if you have additional enrichment, especially regarding infrastructure reuse or victimology.\n\nApologies for any formatting mess, I\u2019m sending this quickly between meetings.

By uploading a specially crafted CSV, an attacker could trigger execution of arbitrary commands when the file is subsequently opened in a spreadsheet application by a privileged user. This risk is heightened by the dashboard's workflow, which automatically packages and sends uploaded reports to analysts for offline processing.\n\nWe have attached a technical report (see: CVD_RTD_CSV_Injection.pdf) detailing:\n- The vulnerable endpoint and affected code segment\n- Sample payloads that successfully triggered the issue\n- Log excerpts from the affected crash events (sanitized for sensitive data)\n- Suggested remediation steps (e.g., escaping formula-initiating characters, content validation on upload)\n\nNo exploitation beyond proof-of-concept testing has occurred. To our knowledge, there is no evidence of compromise or data exfiltration at this time. We have temporarily disabled the upload feature pending further guidance.\n\nGiven the potential for data integrity and confidentiality breaches under GDPR and the requirements of NIS2, we consider this a moderate-risk issue requiring coordinated remediation. We would appreciate advice on disclosure timelines and any additional validation steps you recommend. Please let us know if you require a live demonstration or further details.\n\nThis report is submitted under the CERT-EU Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure policy. Thank you for your support.\n\nBest regards,\n\nDr. Laura Papp\nSenior Security Analyst\nDirectorate-General for Research & Innovation\nEuropean Commission", "created_date": "2024-10-22", "email_address": "laura.papp@ec.europa.eu", "assigned_queue": "OFFSEC::CVD"}

During analysis of our web application workflows, I identified a potential business logic flaw that could allow for unauthorized manipulation of investment portfolio data by regular users. Specifically, the platform\u2019s portfolio optimization module does not properly enforce user permission checks when executing batch data import actions. This could potentially enable a user to inject or overwrite critical portfolio parameters, bypassing intended access controls.\n\nI discovered the issue on 10 June 2024, while conducting scenario-based testing for compliance with internal security guidelines and GDPR data integrity requirements. No evidence of exploitation has been observed, and user activity logs for the affected endpoints (hxxps://invest-tools.ecoa[.]europa[.]eu/api/portfolio/import) have been preserved for reference.\n\nI have attached a technical summary (ecoa_portfolio_logic_flaw.pdf) outlining the request structure and sample payloads that reproduce the vulnerability. My preliminary assessment is that exploitation would require authenticated access but could impact data accuracy and audit trails across several departments if left unaddressed.\n\nI would appreciate CERT-EU\u2019s recommendations on responsible disclosure coordination, as well as any further validation steps you deem necessary.

During lateral movement testing yesterday, we discovered that the Citrix VDI infrastructure (specifically the node at vdi-core-05.digit.europa.eu) was accessible from several non-segmented VLANs. Our initial scan (using Nmap and BloodHound) indicated that RDP ports are open on nodes that should, according to the provided network map, only be reachable from the admin subnet.\n\nTo validate, we attempted RDP connections from a standard user workstation in the HR VLAN (10.88.34.0/24) and were able to reach the VDI login prompt without any MFA challenge. No brute-forcing or password spraying was performed, as per agreed rules of engagement. Screenshots are attached for reference (see 'citrix-access-hr.png').\n\nWe recommend confirming the intended segmentation for these VDI nodes and, if this exposure is unintentional, reviewing firewall ACLs between the HR VLAN and VDI infrastructure. Please advise if you want us to attempt privilege escalation or further lateral movement via this path, or if we should pause until the network team investigates.\n\nLet us know if you need the full scan logs or a live demo during tomorrow\u2019s sync call.

Specifically, SIEM (Splunk) flagged multiple failed and then successful login attempts from a previously unseen IP address (91.201.72.38, geolocated outside usual access regions) against two privileged service accounts: 'svc_data_etl' and 'svc_investment_report'.\n\nFollowing these logins, there was an immediate and sustained increase in database query volume, including complex SELECT and EXPORT statements targeting investment data tables (see partial [db_activity.log] excerpt below):\n\n2024-07-04T18:07:12Z | LOGIN SUCCESS | user: svc_data_etl | IP: 91.201.72.38\n2024-07-04T18:08:34Z | QUERY | user: svc_data_etl | EXPORT investment_data WHERE period > '2023-01-01'\n2024-07-04T18:10:01Z | LOGIN SUCCESS | user: svc_investment_report | IP: 91.201.72.38\n\nDespite patching and updating the analytics toolset (Q2 2024 release), the anomalous activity persisted, suggesting the issue is not related to software compatibility but rather a potential compromise of service account credentials or session hijacking. No relevant software errors were logged. Initial review of system integrity checks shows no signs of tampering with binaries, but several session tokens were observed to be re-used from the suspicious IP.\n\nGiven the sensitivity of investment data and possible implications under NIS2 and GDPR, we have already disabled the affected accounts and revoked all active sessions. Our internal investigation is ongoing, with focus on determining the extent of data accessed and whether any exfiltration occurred. We have preserved forensic images and relevant log files (see attached: 'ecfin-analytics-auth-incident-20240704.zip').\n\nWe request CERT-EU DFIR assistance for deeper forensic triage, identification of root cause (credential compromise vs. session abuse), and recommendations for containment and notification procedures.

Our aim is to ensure a smooth registration process, proper documentation of attendance, and compliance with the latest EU training record-keeping requirements. \n\nAs we finalise the agenda, I would like to clarify a few administrative points to avoid last-minute confusion:\n\n1. Could you please confirm the preferred process for submitting the list of CERT-EU attendees? In the past, we have used the HR-Events shared mailbox, but I am not sure if there have been any updates to this protocol since last year\u2019s sessions.\n\n2. Are there any new requirements for collecting consent forms or privacy acknowledgements from participants, particularly given the recent changes to the data protection guidelines under Regulation (EU) 2018/1725? If so, would you be able to provide the updated template or a link to the relevant intranet page?\n\n3. For external visitors, is there a specific badge request form we should use, or can we continue with the standard Visitor Access Request (VAR) procedure? We had a few issues last autumn with delayed badge processing for non-EU nationals, so any advice to streamline this would be much appreciated.\n\n4. Lastly, is it possible to request a certificate of participation for attendees, as several of our colleagues require official documentation for their annual performance reviews?
